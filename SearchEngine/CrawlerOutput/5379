			     A WEATHER TRAINING COURSE FOR ALL SAILORS                                                                  “Meteorology - Simply for Yachties” is an exciting, brand new and complete PowerPoint self learning CD based training course, which is ideally suited for recreational or more serious dinghy, power boat or inshore/offshore sailors.  It removes most of the mysteries of how the planet’s weather forms and behaves in the northern hemisphere and gives a practical understanding and working knowledge of the principles of meteorology required for safer and more confident sailing and cruising.     This CD replaces the grind of wading through complex theory text books and contains 8 easily absorbed and fully animated lessons (over 500 slides), covering the Atmosphere, Cloud Formation, Weather Fronts, Wind Theory, Mediterranean Winds, Thunderstorms, Visibility and Simple Forecasting.                                                                                                                                       The CD also provides instant PowerPoint classroom lesson material for instructors. The author is an experienced sailor with many hours teaching   Meteorology to student sailors over many years!                               It is not necessary for Microsoft PowerPoint to be installed on your computer, as the CD includes a Microsoft PowerPoint viewer programme which automatically opens the lesson files.       The CD will open and work as long as your operating system is Microsoft Windows 98 SE or more recent. Unfortunately, the CD is not compatible with computers running on an Apple Macintosh operating system.
