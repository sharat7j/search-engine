                            Welcome to the British Columbia Centre of Excellence for Women's Health. Since 1996, we have been a centre of innovation and creativity in the effort to ensure that health and wellness for women is a consideration for policy makers and clinicians. 
                             We promote a women-centred approach to the health of girls and women.  We partner with local community agencies, provincial initiatives, national organizations, and international agencies to conduct research and/or to exchange knowledge among community members, academic researchers, policy makers, and health care professionals. 
                                 
                                We welcome inquiries about our work, our products, and ways that you can become involved with us. Come visit our offices to pick up a publication. Check this site regularly for information about upcoming events, speakers, and conferences. We are located at BC Women's Hospital & Health Centre in Vancouver, Canada.
