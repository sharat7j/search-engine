ANY GOOD MATH LATELY?   
      I have always hated
math.
When I decided to homeschool I never thought past the basic four-
addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division. When my oldest announced that
he wanted to be an engineer and an astronaut, I panicked!

       Basic Algebra
-  Lesson
1 - Evaluating algebra expressions   
      Learn to define
these terms:
variable; algebraic expression; signs of operation; order of operations.
       
       Basic Algebra
-  Lesson
2    
      When
you take information from a sentence and turn it into a mathematical
expression,
it is called "translating."  
       Algebra  Lesson
3 - Solving for X   
      When you solve for
x, you
want to "isolate" the x on one side of the equal sign.  
       Algebra  Lesson
4 - Order of operations   
      What if there are no
parentheses
or brackets? How do you know which to do first? Add, divide, multiply?
Learn the order of operations and you'll never have to worry, again.
       
       Algebra  Lesson
5 - Expressions from equations   
      By the end of this
lesson
the student will be able to: turn word sentences into algebraic
expressions.  
       Algebra  Lesson
6 - Balancing equations to solve variables   
      By the end of this
lesson
the student will be able to balance equations to solve for variables
(solve
for 'x')  
       Algebra  Lesson
7 - Using equations to solve puzzles   
      Learn to set up an
equation
that "matches" in numbers what the puzzle expresses in words. Then,
solve
for the variable.  
       Algebra  Lesson
8 The equation behind an old trick   
      For
years, mathematicians have been solving the following puzzle to the
amazement
of their students.  
       Algebra  Lesson
9 - Positives and negatives on a number line   
      The best way to
"see" negative
and positive numbers is to look at a number line  
       Algebra  Lesson
10 - Absolute values   
      The concept of
absolute
value is important when adding positive and negative numbers
       
       Algebra  Lesson
11 - Additive inverses   
      Adding opposites
using negatives
and positives.  
       Algebra 
Lesson 12 - Multiplying positives and negatives   
      As we learned last
lesson:
Additive Inverses are opposites. Two numbers are opposites if their sum
equals zero. When this principle is used in multiplication, these three
rules of thumb emerge.
