 This set of pages contains
statistical material that I hope
will be of interest to both faculty and students. It was
originally
intended to go with my texts (Statistical
Methods for Psychology and Fundamental Statistics
for the Behavioral Sciences). I have since created
separate sets of pages 
for those books that are linked on the navigation bar to
the left, and
have retained here 
information that is of a more general nature. There is,
however, information 
on those book-related pages that will likely be of
interest to  others not 
using those books. Ê  



 You are welcome to browse, and any
comments that you have are appreciated. I am particularly
interested 
to hear of other things that
you would like me to make
available.  

 Instructors who would like to order review
copies can go to the  Thomson/Wadsworth
Page  and search under my name until you find an order
form.
