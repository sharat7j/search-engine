Welcome to our tournament page for the

 2011 PGA Championship golf tournament 
- the season's
final major.  The PGA Championship returns to the Atlanta Athletic Club
River Highlands course August 8 - 14th 2011. 
 
The PGA Championship is a prestigious title to behold and there have been some
great names in the history of the game of golf who've won it.  Walter Hagen won it four times
in a row.  Gene Sarazen won two, Sam Snead won it, Hogan won it, Nicklaus
won it four times, and Tiger Woods four times.   
 
The Atlanta Athletic club's Highlands course has previously hosted one U.S. Open
in 1976 which was won by Jerry Pate.  Larry Nelson won the PGA here in 1981
and David Toms did the same here in 2001.  Last year Martin Kaymer beat
Bubba Watson in a playoff at Kohler's Whistling Straits after a controversial
rules infraction on the 18th cost Dustin Johnson a shot at the
title.   
 
Who will win here in the heat and humidity of August in Atlanta alongside the Chattahoochee
River?  Stay tuned to get the latest updated news and predictions for this year's PGA Championship
