 Getting the XML of a Single Category: 
 All categories have an index.xml file which contains the XML representation for that category. 

 Our public HTML category pages are generated from these files. 

 Example:  http://musicmoz.org/Bands_and_Artists/E/Evanescence/index.xml 

 Search Results in XML: 
 You can obtain search results in XML by passing the xml=1 parameter to search. 

 Example:  http://musicmoz.org/search/search.cgi?search=a:1999.09.21+t:release&xml=1
