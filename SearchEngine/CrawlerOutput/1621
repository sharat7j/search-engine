            Mission             Twenty-five
              years ago, scientists made a stunning discovery on the bottom of
              the Pacific Ocean that forever changed our understanding of our
              planet, and life on it. They discovered the first deep-sea  hydrothermal  vents,
              and?to their complete surprise?a lush community of exotic
              life thriving around them.             
               
            Dive and Discover?s Expedition 6 returns to the Galápagos
              Rift, where seafloor hydrothermal vents were first found in 1977.
              The discovery of vents spewing warm, mineral-rich fluids into the
              ocean helped explain why the ocean is salty and how our planet
              ventilates its great internal heat. The astonishing  ecosystems  nourished
by the vents revolutionized scientific thinking about where and how life could
exist.
            
             As part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Ocean Exploration Program, scientists on Expedition 6 will return to see how the Galápagos Rift hydrothermal vent communities have changed. They will carry out detailed mapping and sampling, and search for new animal communities and black-smoker vents along still-unexplored areas of the Galápagos Rift.

                                  Objectives 
                Expedition 6 returns to the Galápagos
                Rift at 86°W, where oceanographers in 1977 made one of the
                most revolutionary discoveries about our planet -- deep-sea
                hydrothermal vents. A main objective of this cruise is to investigate
                how the vents and their animal and microbial communities have
                changed over the past 25 years.  
               Hydrothermal vent areas are among the most
                  dynamic, constantly changing places on Earth. They are fueled
                  by the heat of magma welling up from Earth’s mantle and
                  erupting on the seafloor. As the heat varies, different chemical
                  reactions take place between seawater and hot rocks in the
                  ocean crust. As the heat and available chemicals change, so
                  do the types and amounts of microbes that feed on the chemicals.
                  And that affects populations of higher animals that either
                  feed on the microbes or symbiotically maintain them inside
                their bodies.  
               The changes at hydrothermal vents involve many different, interrelated
                organisms and processes. So Expedition 6 will have many different
                types of scientists, working together, to figure out how vents
                and vent life interact and operate.  
               Several types of biologists will be aboard.
                  Ecologists will study changes in Galápagos Rift vent communities that
                have occurred over the past 25 years, and how animals interact
                with each other. Microbiologists will study microbes, which use
                harsh chemicals in vent fluids as sources of energy. Geneticists
                will sample animal tissue to analyze their DNA and RNA and compare
                how Galápagos vent animals are related to animals elsewhere
                on mid-ocean ridges in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans.
                Chemists will study changes in the chemical composition of the
                Galápagos Rift hydrothermal fluids over the last 25 years.
                Geologists will analyze data on board to map the vent sites and
                see how they compare to other vent areas around the world.  
               Expedition 6 scientists will primarily use the deep-diving submersible
                Alvin to study the vents and sample vent animals and fluids.
                They will also use ABE, the Autonomous Benthic Explorer, to produce
              highly detailed maps of seafloor and to search for new vents.

                              An important objective of Expedition
                6 is to explore other regions of the Galápagos Rift, 200 nautical miles west of the
                original vent sites, where volcanic eruptions may have occurred
                recently. Scientists will search for black smoker chimneys, whose
                fluids are hundreds of degrees Celsius hotter than those emanating
                from the vents at 86°W. Black smokers have been found at
                deep-sea vent sites elsewhere on Earth, but not on the Galápagos
                Rift.  
               To search for new vents, scientists will
                  use sensitive instruments called CTDs (stands for Conductivity,
                  Temperature, Depth) and MAPRs (Miniature Autonomous Plume Recorders)
                  to look for the plumes of slightly warm and particle-rich water
                  that rise from hydrothermal vents -- just like columns of vapor
                  rising from smokestacks. In the dark depths of the oceans,
                  these instruments can “see” cloudy
                water and can detect small telltale differences in the temperature
                and other physical properties of the water. They will also use
                a new, digital deep-sea camera system to search for new vents
                and to scout out new areas for Alvin and ABE to investigate.  
               Each day will bring new samples, new discoveries,
                  and new ideas about how hydrothermal vents at the Galápagos
                  Rift have changed since they were first discovered, and new
                  insights into how life evolves in these extreme environments
                on the deep-sea floor.
