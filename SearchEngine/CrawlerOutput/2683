Welcome to
CaddyBytes.com's tournament's page for the 2011 U.S. Open golf
championship being played at
the Congressional CC Blue Course in Bethesda - (greater Washington D.C.) - Md. 
 
The U.S. Open is the oldest golf championship of national prominence in America
with most all the greats of the game winning at least one to justify their
historic resumes.  It is also known as the second leg in the Grand Slam of
Golf. 
 
All the greats of the game have won this tournament except for Sam Snead who
very well may be the greatest of all time.  The last six U.S. Open champions have
been Graeme McDowell winning at Pebble Beach in 2010 and defending here at
Congressional, Lucas Glover winning at Bethpage in '09, Tiger Woods at Torrey
Pines in '08, (his
last major to date), Angel Cabrera at Oakmont in '07, and Geoff Ogilvy at Winged
Foot in 06.   
 
Ernie Els was the last one to win the U.S. Open when it was last played in 1997.  To get the latest updated news
about that as well as predictions for this year's U.S. Open Championship
