The big wild surf of yesterday gave way to cleaned up yet still large peaks limping from the point through the bowl. With N and NW swells overlapping on the North Shore right now, Sunset was just as confusing as yesterday, albeit a bit less dangerous.  Scores were hard to come by today, as most surfers struggled to amass a double digit heat total in the crossed up conditions. Adrian Troyen won heat..             Ex-surfer gains fame for stunning imagery from inside violent surf zone   Clark Little's amazing water world  With the winter storm season approaching and big north swells on the way, it's time for Clark Little to go to work -- in what might be the world's most unusual job for an artist.   Little, a former botanical gardens supervisor and big-wave surfer from Hawaii, has gained fame as an artist photographing monstrous waves at Oahu's Waimea Bay -- from the inside, looking out.   His specialty is Waimea's violent shore-pound, but the "Shorebreak Art of Clark Little" reflects..             "Ghost Wave" reveals chilling tales of Cortes Bank - the world's most ominous wave   ...and home of the record for largest ever ridden  Sebastian Junger, William Finnegan, and Winston Groom are just some of the esteemed authors giving Chris Dixon praise for his new book "Ghost Wave: the discovery of Cortes Bank and the biggest wave on earth."   And rightfully so.   Dixon, the founder of surfermag.com, spent most of the last year researching the world's most frightening maritime hazard, a massive wave that breaks 100 miles out in the middle of the ocean off of San Clemente, California. His goal was to..             Surfing's new big-wave hunters do battle with Western Australian monster   Mark Mathews, Laurie Towner, Richie Vas and the lunatic fringe  The world of big-wave hunting used to be limited to the search for the world's tallest peaks...not anymore.   These days surfers living on the lunatic fringe are scouring the globe for more threatening beasts that -- while not as tall as Maui's Jaws or California's Cortes Bank -- pack more punch per square foot in a pound-for-pound comparison.   These shorter, stockier, thicker waves mutate into more harrowing vortexes because of the way approaching swells abruptly slam..

The real ASP ratings post Reef Hawaiian Pro    November 23, 2011  It was hardly pretty, but the Reef Hawaiian Pro did manage to produce some solid surfing on Wednesday as the waves finally became contestable. While Taj Burrow stole the headlines with his win, the battle for 2012 qualification was the major subplot to this week's story, and there was indeed some movement.   Nat Young cracked the Top 50 of the "real rankings" with his appearance in the Final, while Adam Melling salvaged his shot at requalifying with a strong second place finish,..
