		Making science accessible 
		 http://wise.berkeley.edu/pages/theory/accessible.php  
		 WISE
(the Web-based Inquiry Science Environment) is a simple yet powerful

analyze current scientific controversies. This video clip shows how
science is made accessible by allowing learners to connect new ideas to
those they already have. Effective instruction should provide
opportunities for students to evaluate scientific evidence.......  View Full GSDL Record
