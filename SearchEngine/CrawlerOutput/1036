Introductory Statistics: EPR Approach  
 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
   D  ear Colleague, 
 I would like to show you an effective new approach to teaching the
introductory statistics course. I have written three papers about the approach,
the abstracts of which follow: 
 The Introductory Statistics Course: 
The Entity-Property-Relationship Approach 
 Abstract: This paper proposes six concepts for discussion at the
beginning of an introductory statistics course for students who are not
majoring in statistics or mathematics. The concepts are (1) entities, (2)
properties of entities, (3) variables, (4) a major goal of empirical research:
to predict and control the values of variables, (5) relationships between
variables as a key to prediction and control, and (6) statistical techniques
for studying relationships between variables as a means to accurate prediction
and control. After students have learned the six concepts they learn standard
statistical topics in terms of the concepts. It is recommended that each
concept be taught in a bottom-up fashion with emphasis on concrete practical
examples. It is suggested that the approach gives students a lasting
appreciation of the vital role of the field of statistics in empirical
research.  
 This paper contains 31,000 words and 190 references and is available over
the Internet in four formats:

 Eight Features of an Ideal Introductory
Statistics Course 
 Abstract: This paper discusses the following features of the author's
ideal introductory statistics course: (1) a clear statement of the goals of the
course, (2) a careful discussion of the fundamental concept of 'variable', (3)
a unification of statistical methods under the concept of a relationship
between variables, (4) a characterization of hypothesis testing that is
consistent with standard empirical research, (5) the use of practical examples,
(6) the right mix of pedagogical techniques: lectures, readings, discussions,
exercises, activities, group work, multimedia, (7) a proper choice of
computational technology, and (8) a de-emphasis of less important topics such
as univariate distributions, probability theory, and the mathematical theory of
statistics. The appendices contain (a) recommendations for research to test
different approaches to the introductory course and (b) discussion of
thought-provoking criticisms of the recommended approach.

 On July 17, 1998 I posted the abstract of the "Eight Features"
paper (available above) to sci.stat.edu and EdStat-L. Following are my
responses to comments about the abstract and paper:  
  response to comments by
Dennis Roberts  (July 23, 1998) re teaching univariate distributions at the
beginning of the introductory course; are univariate distributions boring? when
univariate distributions are necessary 
  response to comments by
Mark Myatt  (July 30, 1998) re teaching univariate distributions at the
beginning of the introductory course; the role of univariate distributions in
exploratory data analysis 
  response to comments by
Rolf Dalin  (July 31, 1998) re omitting teaching univariate distributions at
the beginning of the introductory course; other goals and features of the
introductory course 
  response to comments by
Gary Smith  (November 23, 1998) re three interesting examples of univariate
distributions (election predictions, average body temperature, and the speed of
light); how these examples fit into the rubric of relationships between
variables; why questions about univariate distributions are less important in
an introductory statistics course; APPENDICES: are relationships
"between" or "among" variables? physical constants versus
entities, properties, and relationships; the role of constants (physical and
otherwise) in empirical research; ways of viewing empirical research projects 
 
  response to comments by
Rossi Hassad  (November 25, 1998) re whether there is a necessary logical
progression from univariate distributions to relationships between variables;
whether the constructivist view of learning implies that we must first discuss
univariate distributions; the relationship between relationships between
variables and univariate distributions; the simplicity of the issues 
  response to more comments
by Dennis Roberts  (May 2, 1999) re the breadth of application of
statistical ideas; whether almost all empirical research projects can be
usefully characterized as studying relationships between variables; some
statistical methods that can not be easily characterized as studying
relationships between variables; evidence that univariate distributions
alienate students; why some students find statistics to be boring; how to make
the introductory statistics course fascinating 
  response to comments by
Karl L. Wuensch  (May 9, 1999) re two examples of univariate distributions
that may be of interest at the beginning of the introductory course; the notion
of "payoff" as a key to why relationships between variables are more
interesting than univariate distributions; why teachers continue to discuss
univariate distributions; a situation in which univariate distributions
are of interest 
  response to comments by
Herman Rubin  (May 16, 1999) re the importance of univariate distributions
in actual problems; what is needed to discuss relationships between variables?
can a relationship exist between random variables? a definition of a
relationship between variables; APPENDICES: should it be
"relationship" or "relation" between variables? testing for
a relationship between variables in Francis Galton's height data 
  response to comments by
Jan de Leeuw  (October 31, 1999) re the usefulness of the concept of
'external world'; a comparison of two definitions of the role of statistics;
confusion about hypothesis testing; alternate formulations of the distinction
between univariate distributions and relationships between variables; the
importance of univariate summaries; a survey of the types of statistical
statements in a newspaper; statistics as a service activity; the distinction
between the descriptive and action-prescriptive aspects of statistics 
  response to comments by
Bob Hayden  (July 23, 2000) a comparison of four popular types of plots to
show the relationship between a continuous response variable and a discrete
predictor variable; the order of teaching (a) the concept of
'relationship between variables' and (b) data plots in an introductory
statistics course; teaching students the underlying conceptual
principles of statistics versus teaching them the underlying
mathematical principles; a practical first detailed example of a
relationship between variables in an introductory statistics course; a system
for collecting student course-work-time data; the visual t-test

  response to comments by
Ronan Conroy  (February 6, 2001) the substantial contributions of
Andr-Marie Ampre; Ampre's elucidation of the scientific
method; a very brief history of the use of the concept of 'relationship between
variables'; a possible model of animal learning in terms of relationships
between variables; the role of relationships between variables in an approach
to machine learning; the concepts of 'population' and 'sample' in empirical
research in the physical sciences; why statistical methods are used less often
in the physical sciences; how statistical methods might have helped in the cold
fusion controversy; the undefined nature of the concepts of 'entity' and
'property'; the concept of a "measure" of the value of a property;
the concept of the "true" value of a property; formality and
informality in the progress of science; comments on undefined concepts in
physics 
 
 
  Definition of
"Relationship Between Variables"  (response to comments by Jan de
Leeuw, Herman Rubin, and Robert Frick; January 28, 2002) evaluation of seven
general definitions of the concept of 'relationship between variables'; a
recommended definition of "relationship between variables" for
students who are not majoring in statistics or mathematics; must we force
students and clients to clamber from their own "space" into our
statistics "space"? must we discuss univariate distributions or
underlying mathematics at the beginning of an introductory statistics course
for students who are not majoring in statistics or mathematics?
