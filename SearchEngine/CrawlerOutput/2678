Welcome
to CaddyBytes.com?s Tournament's page for
the 2011 Shark Shootout golf tournament.  Franklin Templeton is back
as sponsor for the 2011 Shark Shootout. The Tiburon Golf
Club will host this event for the 10th consecutive time. The Shark Shootout has been a post season Greg Norman sponsored event since 1989.   
 
This has been Greg Norman's tournament and always will be.  The 'Shark Shootout' was previously held at
Sherwood Country Club from 1989-99 before moving to it's present post season
Florida venue.  (Sherwood CC is home to Tiger's Target World Challenge
played there now in December.)   
 
 The Shark Shootout is a 72 hole tournament featuring
12 two player teams who compete over 72 holes with a different format each
day.  Player's are invited via Greg Norman and the event has raised a lot
of money for charity in it's 16 year history.
