   How can I use RSS?  
    
    Typical applications for consuming or using RSS include:    Using a program known as a News Aggregator to collect, update and display RSS feeds  Incorporating RSS feeds into weblogs  
      News Aggregators (also called news readers) will download and display RSS feeds for you. A number of free and commercial News Aggregators are available for download. Popular news readers include AmphetaDesk, NetNewsWire, and Radio Userland.  Many aggregators are separate, "stand-alone" programs such as those listed above; other services will let you add RSS feeds to a Web page. Yahoo! lets you add RSS feeds to your My Yahoo! page; to make this easier, you can click on the "Add to My Yahoo!" button above. 

      Another way many people use RSS feeds is by incorporating content into weblogs, or "blogs". Blogs are web pages comprised of usually short, frequently updated items and web links. Blogging as a publishing tool is used for many purposes: traditional journalism, personal journals, group discussions around a topic, and many combinations in-between.
