 Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE) is a National Centre of the 
 
Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) , Mumbai.  
The broad goals of the Centre are to promote equity and excellence in science 
and mathematics education from primary school to undergraduate college level, and 
encourage the growth of scientific literacy in the country.  
 Activities  
 To these ends it carries out a wide spectrum of inter-related activities, 
which may be viewed under three broad categories: 
   Research and Development     Teacher Orientation and Science Popularisation    Olympiads ,  NIUS  and other 
Students' Nurture Programmes.    
 Three decades after its inception, HBCSE has emerged as the premier institution 
in the country for research and development in science, technology and 
mathematics education. It is India's nodal centre for Olympiad programmes in 
Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Astronomy. 
 Graduate School  
 HBCSE (TIFR) runs a  Graduate School in Science Education . Students admitted to
HBCSE Graduate School work towards the Ph.D. degree of the  

Tata Institute of Fundamental Research ( TIFR )  which is a Deemed University.
