          The Poles: Comparing the Poles 
  
 The biggest difference is that the Arctic region is essentially a frozen ocean surrounded by continents. Antarctica is a continent surrounded by an ocean. And even though the Arctic is mostly a frozen ocean, the Arctic climate is more hospitable to human and animal life than the ice-locked Antarctic continent. See a simple comparison table below:
