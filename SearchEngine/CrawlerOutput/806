 The great Tom Watson once  
said "When I learned how to breathe, 
I learned how to win" - a statement 
that provides a terrific insight into 
the importance of correct breathing 
as a means of maintaining an emotional 
and physical balance. 
 Certainly, many golfers struggle 
with this fundamental skill, which 
means they are prey to the emotional 
highs and lows of the game, simply 
because they don't stay focused on 
their breathing and, as a result, let 
mental interference get in the way. 
 In this article I'm going to introduce 
you to the ancient art of Chi 
Kung - literally translated as breath 
or energy work - and how it can help 
improve your game. 
 What's this got to do with golf? 
 Well, many of you will have read 
about the benefits of controlling your 
breathing correctly (it receives a fair 
amount of coverage as a part of the 
"inner game") but the simple truth is, 
unless you actually practise the discipline 
on a regular basis, you will 
never gain the many benefits it can 
bring to your golf and life. 
 Yet, if you can incorporate it into 
your weekly schedule, this basic Chi 
Kung exercise will help you to develop 
a greater awareness of your 
mental state - fear, anticipation, 
anger, excitement (all happening on 
a golf course near you!) - and you'll 
have the tools to take yourself back 
to a more relaxed state, simple by focusing 
on your breathing. 
 Chi Kung - the Practise of 
Standing Meditation 
 • Stand in a natural posture, your feet 
shoulder-width, toes pointing outwards just 
slightly, your knees 'soft', your arms hanging 
loose at your sides and your head as if 
gently suspended from above. Allow your 
eyes to gaze gently, a mile into the distance, 
and relax your chest - but without 
slouching or allowing your shoulders to roll 
forward. 
 • Now, place your attention in your lower 
abdomen, just below the navel, at a point 
called the 'T'an Tien'. Allow yourself to 
focus quietly on your breathing, silently repeating 
"I am breathing in - I am breathing 
out" while you inhale and exhale. 
 • Gently soften and relax more as you 
stand with quiet awareness on your breathing 
and try to maintain a calm and steady 
focus on your centre-point.  The challenge is to hold your posture 
and maintain awareness of your 
breathing for at least 20 minutes (you 
then repeat the exercise 3 times per 
week). Clients who've made a commitment 
to this simple practise have 
reported many benefits, including 
feeling more relaxed, recovering 
more quickly from poor shots, a better 
eye for the target, fewer swing 
thoughts, better powers of visualisation 
and so on. 
 So how can you incorporate this 
technique into your own golf game? 
 Once you can comfortably stand 
for 20 minutes (and it may well take 
you several weeks to master this, as 
at first 5 minutes will seem like a lifetime!), 
you will start to gain greater 
awareness of your mind and body 
and can incorporate the learning into 
the following swing drill. 
 Chi Kung Swing 
 • Stand at address and focus your mind on 
your T'an Tien (your body's natural centre 
of gravity, approx 2" below the navel). 
  • Take a few moments to relax and centre 
yourself as you breathe. Keep your shoulders 
down, your chest empty and relax your 
jaw. 
 • Breathe in while you move to the top of 
your backswing, and then exhale all the way 
through to your finish. Focus entirely on 
your breathing and trust your swing. 
 • Try this drill 6 times "empty-handed" (i.e. 
without holding a club) and then try it with 
your favourite club and/or driver, but without 
striking a ball. 
 • Note your feedback on a scale of 1-10 (1=poor, 10=excellent).  
 Score in the following 
way for each drill: 
 #1 How focused were you on your breathing, 
did you manage to empty your mind of 
all other swing thoughts? 
 #2 How relaxed did you feel during your 
swing? 
 #3 Did you notice a greater feeling of stability 
throughout your swing?  Now step up to the ball and hit 
shots while staying completely focused 
on your breathing. Relax and 
enjoy!  For more information please contact
