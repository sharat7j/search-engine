			 Many people assume that if something is low in fat, they can eat huge quantities of it and not gain weight. 
 If you follow this reasoning, you’ll balloon! 
 Low-fat foods are meant to be substituted for equal amount of full-fat foods. Only in this case they are benefitial. 
 For example, you are much better off drinking 1 cup of full-fat milk than 2 cups of fat-free milk. 
 Also, low-fat foods are sometimes still very high in calories. For example, one fat-free muffin usually has around 200 calories… This makes 2 fat-free muffins have more calories than a cheeseburger!
