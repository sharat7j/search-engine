                     Dalembert wants to sign with Heat  
                    By       Mark J. Miller  /  Scoop Du Jour   
                   
                  
                  
                   
                        The  Miami Heat  is about to start loading up again for its attempt at an NBA championship with  LeBron James  (notes) ,  Dwyane Wade  (notes) , and  Chris Bosh  (notes)  onboard. The team's main need is at center and it  already has a big talented fella knocking at the door  who would like to suit up. FOX Sports has it that 6-11  Samuel Dalembert  (notes)  would like to sign on with the Heat this offseason. "Miami is where more than 50 of his relatives live and is about one hour south of his home in Boca Raton," the site notes.   Dalembert made $13.43 million last season with the  Sacramento Kings , but might have to find a way to survive on only a $5 million midlevel contract, FOX reports, due to Miami's already overstuffed payroll.   "I'm keeping all my options open, but Miami could be a good fit for me," Dalembert said, according to FOX. "If you look at the playoffs with Dallas, you saw what (Mavericks center)  Tyson Chandler  (notes)  did. He was basically a key ingredient for them to win a championship. And Miami didn't have somebody like that. Somebody able to stop (foes from) getting second shots and somebody able to rebound and finish. I could fill that role and be an asset for that team."  The 30-year-old Dalembert averaged 8.1 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 1.45 blocks last season for the Kings.  Let the rumors come to you. Follow Scoop du Jour on  Twitter  or  Facebook .

                     Texans not calling on Favre  
                    By       Mark J. Miller  /  Scoop Du Jour   
                   
                  
                  
                   
                        The  Houston Texans  have lost starting quarterbacks  Matt Schaub  (notes)  and  Matt Leinart  (notes)  for the season in the past several weeks, but that doesn't mean the team is going to make a desperation call. Texans GM Rick Smith told SI.com that the team  isn't going to call  on  Brett Favre  (notes) , who has come out of retirement on more than one occasion, to come back and play hero for his team.   Plus, SI has it that Favre hasn't even thrown a football since early November so it wouldn't be easy to get the 42-year-old back into shape fast enough to be effective as the season heads into the stretch run.  The Texans currently lead the AFC South by two games with an 8-3 record after a 20-13 win over the  Jacksonville Jaguars  that found rookie  T.J. Yates  (notes)  calling the shots by game's end. Yates went 8-for-15 for 70 yards. He also attempted to run the ball four times, but lost three yards in the process.  Don't forget to follow Scoop du Jour on  Twitter  or  Facebook .

                     Broxton not signing with Mets

                        The  New York Mets  were hoping to sign closer  Jonathan Broxton  (notes)  this offseason but it doesn't look like that is going to happen. The New York Post heard from Broxton's agent, BB Abbot, "I  don't think it will be New York  for him." However, some team will be making a happy announcement of a Broxton signing in the near future, the paper notes, since Abbot told the paper that his situation will be "resolved shortly."   The 6-3, 295-pound Broxton, a 27-year-old two-time All-Star, has spent his first seven seasons in the majors with the  Los Angeles Dodgers , amassing a 25-20 record with 84 saves, 503 strikeouts, and a 3.19 ERA.

                     Crawford headed to Knicks or Nets?

                        Now that the new NBA collective bargaining agreement is thisclose to being a done deal, free-agent signing rumors are starting to suddenly bubble up. No player can sign with a new team till Dec. 9.   The word from the New York Daily News is that one of those free agents, veteran shooting guard  Jamal Crawford  (notes) , is likely to sign with a former employer, the  New York Knicks , or the  New Jersey Nets , if the  Atlanta Hawks  don't make a good enough effort to re-sign him.  The 30-year-old Crawford, who is repped by New Jersey-based Andy Miller at ASM Sports,  would like to return to the New York area , a source tells the paper.  Crawford, who won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award in 2010, last played for the Knicks back in the 2008-09 season before being traded to the  Golden State Warriors . He's spent the last two seasons with the Hawks, where he averaged 14.2 points, 3.2 assists, and 1.7 rebounds per game last year.   Let the rumors come to you.

                     Astros toss GM Wade  
                    By       Mark J. Miller  /  Scoop Du Jour   
                   
                  
                  
                   
                        The month before Ed Wade was hired by the  Houston Astros  to be the general manager back in 2007, he went parachuting in New Jersey and found himself  accidentally dangling from a tree . He must have had a similar feeling in recent days as his future with the team seemed tenuous as best. FOX Sports reported Sunday that the team  would be canning Wade on Monday.  The  team then  confirmed that report  in a press release, according to MLBTradeRumors.com.   The 55-year-old Wade started his baseball career back in 1977 as a public-relations intern with the  Philadelphia Phillies  before eventually serving as that team's general manager from 1998 to 2005. In Philly, Wade was responsible for drafting  Chase Utley  (notes) ,  Ryan Howard  (notes) , and  Cole Hamels  (notes)  as well as hiring manager Charlie Manuel. In Houston, many of his biggest trades have been with the Phillies, sending  Brad Lidge  (notes) ,  Roy Oswalt  (notes) , and  Hunter Pence  (notes)  to his former employer.

                        Bobby Valentine and Gene Lamont are said to the be  the last men standing  in the search for a new manager for the  Boston Red Sox , according to ESPN, but neither had received an offer as of Sunday night.  Detroit Tigers  third-base coach Lamont, who has managed the  Pittsburgh Pirates  and  Oakland Athletics , met with Red Sox majority owner John Henry on Tuesday in Boca Raton, Florida, the site notes, "where Henry maintains a home" and then flew up to New York the next day to talk with Red Sox chairman Tom Werner.  "I've talked to people,'' the soon-to-be 65-year-old Lamont said, ESPN reports, "but I don't know what their time frame is now.''  The 61-year-old Valentine hasn't managed in the majors since 2002. His best season came in 2000 when he took the  New York Mets  to the World Series. He also won the Japan Series in 2005 with the Chiba Lotte Marines before returning to the States in 2009 to become an analyst with ESPN.  Let the rumors come to you.

                        Free agent third baseman  Aramis Ramirez  (notes)  has been with the  Chicago Cubs  since 2003 but the team's new management doesn't seen to expect him to return to the Windy City. Now it looks like another team is interested in bringing the 33-year-old three-time All-Star back to the Midwest. SI.com reports that the  Detroit Tigers  are  inquiring about Ramirez , who hit .306 with 26 homers and 35 doubles last season.  The Tigers are also  interested in making a run  at snagging 32-year-old free agent pitcher  Mark Buehrle  (notes) , the Detroit News reports, but know they have stiff competition for the guy who has gone 161-119 in his career with a 3.83 ERA.
