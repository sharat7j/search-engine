 baseball legend AND U.S. MILITARY HERO 

 caddy for a cure at shell houston open 
  Roger Clemens Participates with Charity Program 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

      Roger Clemens could not have chosen a more appropriately named town to participate in the Caddy For A Cure program.  On Wednesday this week (March 30), the seven-time Cy Young Award-winning baseball legend caddied for Ryan Palmer during the Shell Houston Pro-Am as part of the PGA TOUR’s Shell Houston Open at Redstone Golf Club in Humble, Texas. This marks the first time that a celebrity has donated his or her time caddying for a TOUR player with the Caddy For A Cure charitable program. 
      Clemens and a few of his friends purchased the opportunity for him to caddy for Palmer, all in the name of charity. Clemens and his wife, Debbie, have long been charity-minded as demonstrated by the non-profit Roger Clemens Foundation (www.rogerclemensonline.com) they established to support educational, charitable, literary, scientific and religious activities for children throughout Texas, with an emphasis on disadvantaged/at-risk children and those with special needs. 
      As part of its partnership with the PGA TOUR Birdies for the Brave program, a national military outreach initiative proudly supported by the PGA TOUR, Caddy For A Cure proudly recognized and honored U.S. military wounded warrior and Texas native PJ Johns, who walked alongside Clemens during the experience with Palmer.  During his nearly 12 years of service in the U.S. Navy, Johns was a nuclear electrician and was twice deployed to the Persian Gulf where in 2006 he was severely injured aboard the USS Nimitz. PJ is currently enrolled in Texas A&M Kingsville. 
      "Our objective has always been to offer golf fans the best and most unique experiences in professional golf; to let them see it from an insider’s perspective by bringing them closer to the game and to the players,” said veteran PGA TOUR caddy and Caddy For A Cure Founder Russ Holden.  “While we’ve had most of the world’s best TOUR players participate with us before, this was the first time we’ve ever had a celebrity offer to caddy for one of the players.  Roger Clemens is one of the most accomplished athletes in all of sports, and the fact that he wanted to take this opportunity to combine his passion for golf with his heart for helping others is very telling about Roger. When he learned about the participation of wounded warrior PJ, Roger could not have been more inspired or enthusiastic. And the day didn’t disappoint Roger!” 
      Proceeds from the Roger Clemens caddying experience will support the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund; the PGA TOUR Birdies for the Brave initiative; the PGA TOUR Caddy Assistance Fund; the Houston Golf Association as selected by the host site and the Ryan Palmer Foundation (www.ryanpalmerfoundation.org) as designated by Ryan Palmer.
