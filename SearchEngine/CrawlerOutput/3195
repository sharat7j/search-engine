			"It made sense for us to handle our safety planning the right way. If we were going to take the responsibility to do it, we wanted to do it properly.  I didn't have the time to spend.  We were also concerned about the liability for not doing it right the first time."

	 We live, in fact, in a world starved for solitude, silence, and privacy: and therefore starved for meditation and true friendship.
