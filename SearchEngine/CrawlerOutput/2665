  Privacy Policy for CaddyBytes.com  
 


 The privacy of our visitors to CaddyBytes.com is important to us. 
 At CaddyBytes.com, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is
important. Here is information on what types of personal information we receive
and collect when you use and visit CaddyBytes.com, and how we safeguard your
information. We never sell your personal information to third parties. 
 Log Files 
 As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log
files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol)
address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the
browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the
time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site. 
 Cookies and Web Beacons 
 We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences
when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in
your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums. 
 We also use third party advertisements on CaddyBytes.com to support our site.
Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons
when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as
Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP
address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases,
whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting
purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example)
or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking
ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). 
 DoubleClick DART cookies 
 We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google?s DoubleClick,
which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a
site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense
advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your
interests (?interest based targeting?). The ads served will be targeted
based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing
sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when
viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses ?non
personally identifiable information?. It does NOT track personal information
about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number,
social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can
opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting
http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx 
 You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party
cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as
Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact
with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to
login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts. 
 Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any
advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next
time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
