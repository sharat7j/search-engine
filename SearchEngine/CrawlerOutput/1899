              We Are 
              NALGAP; The National Association of Lesbian and Gay Bisexual and Transgender Addiction Professionals 
              is a membership organization founded in 1979 and dedicated to the 
              prevention and treatment of alcoholism, substance abuse, and other 
              addictions in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer communities.  
             Our 
              Mission Statement 
              NALGAP's mission is to confront all forms of oppression and discriminatory 
              practices in the delivery of services to all people and to advocate

              NALGAP provides information, training, networking, and advocacy 
              about addiction and related problems, and support for those engaged 
              in the health professions, individuals in recovery, and others concerned 
              about the health of gender and sexual minorities.
