                With light trades this morning and 
                great weather, the Amateur team made a strong charge today to 
                retain the Governor John A. Burns Challenge Cup at Mid Pacific 
                Country Club.  The amateurs won 9 of the 12 matches, halved one 
                match and lost just 2 matches getting 9 ? points today to finish 
                the tournament 14 ? points to 9 ? points.  This makes it 5 years 
                in a row that the amateurs have won the match.  Congratulations 
                to the Amateur Team and to Captain Phil Anamizu and Assistant 
                Captain Les Tamashiro. Ron Castillo, Jr and Damien Jamilla were 
                the only two people who did not lose a point with a 2-0-1 record 
                for both.  All others had at least one loss during the matches.  Final

                The 2 nd  round of the 
                Governor John A. Burns Challenge Cup has completed with the 
                Professional team making a charge winning 4 ? of the possible 6 
                points.  The teams of Kevin Carll(P)/Matt Pakkala(P), Beau 
                Yokomoto(P)/Regan Lee(P), Garrett Okamura(P)/Kevin Shimomura(P), 
                and Larry Stubblefield(P)/Ron Castillo, Jr(P) all won their 
                matches this afternoon.  The match of Richard Hattori(a)/Seung Jae 
                Maeng(a) was halved with Shane Abe(P)/Damien Jamilla(P).  The 
                Amateur team of Lorens Chan/John Oda won the last match. Going 
                into tomorrow?s matches, the Professional team has the lead 7 to 
                5 and has good momentum as they look to end the Amateur?s team 
                streak of winning the cup four years in a row. 
      
                
       
      
                 11.21.2011 AM--  
                With mostly sunny skies and strong 
                trade winds, the first round of the Governor?s Cup is underway 
                at Mid-Pacific Country Club.  The Governor?s Cup is a Ryder Cup 
                Style golf event where the best amateurs in the state play 
                against the best professionals in the state in a match play 
                format for points. After the morning round of matches in a 
                Better Ball format, the Amateur team led by Captain Phil Anamizu 
                and Assistant Captain Les Tamashiro is leading the cup 3 ? 
                points to 2 ? points.  With 5 of the 6 matches going all the way 
                to the 18 th  hole to determine the results, the 
                matches have been very fierce amongst the competitors.  It seems 
                the professional team led by Ron Castillo, Sr, Ron Castillo, Jr 
                and Wade Nishimoto is determined to win the cup back after 
                losing the cup for the last 4 years.
