						 Overview 
						
 The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) provides reliable and timely data on the mathematics and science achievement of U.S. 4th- and 8th-grade students compared to that of students in other countries. TIMSS data have been collected in 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007.  
 The TIMSS International Data Explorer (IDE) is now available for users to create their own tables and charts, and perform statistical tests with data from TIMSS 2007. The TIMSS IDE is modeled after the NAEP Data Explorer and functions the same way. Data from earlier rounds of TIMSS will be added in the near future. The TIMSS IDE can be  accessed here . 
 In 2011, more than 60 countries and jurisdictions, including the United States, will participate in TIMSS. More than 20,000 students in more than 1,000 schools across the United States will take the assessment in spring 2011, joining  almost 500,000 other students around the world taking part in TIMSS.  Because the  Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS)  will also be administered at grade four in spring 2011, TIMSS and PIRLS in the United States will be administered in the same schools to the extent feasible. Students will take either TIMSS or PIRLS on the day of the assessments. 
 In addition, to address the interest in states benchmarking to international standards, NCES is initiating a new effort to link the states scores from the national assessment?NAEP-- to TIMSS. The 2011 NAEP-TIMSS Linking Study is designed to provide all states with estimates that compare their own students? performance against international benchmarks. Read more about the 2011 NAEP-TIMSS Link  here .
