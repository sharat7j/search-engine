    Welcome to the twentieth issue of Science in School  

  
   
     
	 
		 
			 
				 
			 
				 
					I am delighted to announce that our publisher, EIROforum, has agreed to fund Science in School for a further two years, with enough money to cover the online production. We are also making every effort to continue printing your favourite science-teaching journal, for you to read on the train, refer to again and again, or share with colleagues, students and friends – but we need your help.

    Welcome to the nineteenth issue of Science in School  

  
   
     
	 
		 
			 
				 
			 
				 
					Life in space – scientists and lay people alike are intrigued by this possibility. Recently, astronomers have found a planet orbiting a star that  entered the Milky Way from another galaxy . Does that whet your appetite for space travel? Why not discuss what we would need to live on another planetary body and get your students to  design a space habitat ?
