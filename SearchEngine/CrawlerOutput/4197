			 Your Body Mass Index (BMI) is:  
			 A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered healthy for adults. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight, while a BMI of 30 and above is considered obese. People with BMIs of 18.5 or less are considered underweight.

			 Your Waist-to-Height Ratio is:  
			 Your Body Shape Indicates:  
			 A waist-to-height ratio under .50 is generally considered healthy. This ratio may give a more accurate assessment of health for people who are muscular or for women who have a "pear" rather then an "apple" body shape. 
			 
			 Be Careful: You have a thin shape and you may need to gain weight. 
			 Healthy: You have a healthy shape!  
			 Increased Risk: This measurement indicates a "pear" body shape.  Excess fat is stored around the hips and thighs, which is less harmful to health than fat stored around the belly (an apple shape). 
			 Take Action: This measurement indicates an "apple" body shape.  Excess fat stored in the stomach area increases your risk of serious conditions such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer.

			 Please Note: You should never allow your daily caloric intake to fall below 1,200 calories because you may not get enough nutrients. Also, excessive calorie restriction could slow your metabolism and hinder your weight goals. 
			 In addition to a low-calorie diet, exercising for at least 30 minutes per day at your target heart rate is the most effective way of losing weight and keeping it off.
