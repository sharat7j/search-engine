 What is Mole Day? 
 Celebrated annually on October 23 from 6:02 a.m. to 6:02 p.m., Mole Day
commemorates Avogadro's Number (6.02 x 10^23), which is a basic measuring
unit in chemistry.  Mole Day was created as a way to foster interest in
chemistry.  Schools throughout the United States and around the world
celebrate Mole Day with various activities related to chemistry and/or moles. 
 For a given molecule, one mole is a mass (in grams) whose number is equal to
the atomic mass of the molecule.  For example, the water molecule has an atomic mass of 18, therefore one mole of water weighs 18 grams.  An atom of
neon has an atomic mass of 20, therefore one mole of neon weighs 20 grams. In
general, one mole of any substance contains Avogadro's Number of molecules
or atoms of that substance.  This relationship was first discovered by Amadeo
Avogadro (1776-1858) and he received credit for this after his death.

MOLE  PLEDGE 

 (Background:  When saying the
pledge of allegiance to the U.S. flag, one faces the flag.  If no flag is
present, one should face our nation's capitol, Washington D.C.  When saying
the pledge to the mole, a real mole is usually not present.  So, one should
bend over and face the earth!) 

 I pledge allegiance to the mole, and to the science from which
it comes, one SI unit, extremely divisible, with micromoles and
millimoles for all.     (Provided by R.
Thomas Myers - Kent State University, Kent, OH) 

   

 I pledge allegiance to the mole, to the International Union of
Pure and Applied Chemistry, and to the atomic mass for which it stands, one
number, most divisible, with atoms and molecules for
all.
