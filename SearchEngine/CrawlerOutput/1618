               asthenosphere: the layer in the Earth below the lithosphere
                that is weak, probably due to the presence of some molten material.
              It is this weak layer that allows the tectonic plates to move.

              less dense than its surroundings.

               consumer: organisms that get their energy from eating other
 
               convection: the circulatory motion that occurs in fluids due

               CTD (conductivity/temperature/depth): One of the most commonly
                used electronic instruments in oceanography, which is lowered
                on a conducting cable from a ship to measure the temperature,
                pressure and electrical conductivity of ocean water and the height
                above the seafloor. From these measurements, scientists can calculate
                water depth, salinity, and density. By letting cable out or pulling
                it in, scientists can measure water properties at different depths.
                Some CTDs have batteries and computers that allow them to be
                self-recording so they can be moored in one spot to make measurements
              for days or months.

                rises more than 1 km above the seafloor but whose peak is below
                the sea surface. 
 sediment trap: an oceanographic instrument used to collect material floating down to the seafloor from above 
 sedimentary rock: a rock formed from the consolidation
 
                seep: A small area where water ? that may be of a different
                temperature and density flows from below the seafloor and rises
              slowly into the ocean.  
               seismic wave: waves generated either by an earthquake or artificially. 
               sonar: acronym for sound navigation and
                  ranging. A device that is used primarily for the detection
                  and location of underwater objects by reflecting acoustic (sound)
                  waves from them. 
               subduction zone: the region where one lithospheric plate descends
                beneath another as the two plates are moving towards each other.
                It is characterized by a line of earthquakes that demarcate the
              upper edge of the descending plate. 
   symbiosis: close physiological relationship between two different organisms for the majority of their life cycles. If the relationship benefits both organisms, it is called mutualism. If one organism benefits at the expense of the other, it is called parasitism. If one organism benefits and the other is neither helped nor harmed, it is called commensalism. 
 symbiotic algae: algae (a simple type of plant
                that can photosynthesize) that live together with another organism
  in a mutually beneficial relationship.

               tectonics: a field of geology dealing with processes that shape
              the Earth's surface. 
               transform fault: a type of plate boundary where
                two plates slide past each other. 
               transponder: An acoustic device that scientists place above
                the seafloor, usually in groups of two or more, to help them
                navigate deep submergence vehicles. To locate a transponder,
                a ping is broadcast from a ship to the seafloor. If the transponder
                hears the ping, it sends a reply ping, letting researchers know
                they?re in the right place. The transponder and its batteries
                are protected inside a plastic case the size of a beach ball,
              and can operate from the seafloor for up to five years.

               uranium-series dating: a method of dating material
                that contains elements that have been formed by radioactive decay
                of uranium.

                rock, and/or rock fragments through openings in the earth's surface.

 water mass: a body of seawater that shares
                the same origin. Each water mass has characteristic temperatures
                and salinities.
