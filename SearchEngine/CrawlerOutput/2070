Without hitting a ball competitively this past week, Charley Hull, the 16-year-old Woburn player, has risen to No 10 in the RandA Women's World Amateur Golf Rankings. 
Unlike the men's ratings, there are surprisingly few American females in the top 10 which continues to be headed by the New Zealand teenagers Lydia Ko and Cecilia Cho. 
US college student Stephanie Meadow from Northern Ireland is the highest ranked European player and looks a certainty to make her Curtis Cup debut for GB and Ireland in the Curtis Cup match against the Americans at Nairn next June. Stephanie was a reserve for last year's match at Essex County Club, Massachusetts. 
Leona Maguire (No 7) gives Ireland two in the world's top 10 which is quite an achievement. Leona (and her twin Lisa) both played in the 2010 Curtis Cup match. 
But, like Stephanie Meadow, Charley Hull, pictured above by Cal Carson Golf Agency in action in the inaugural Junior Vagliano Trophy match at Royal Porthcawl last June, is another whose claims for a first Curtis Cup cap look gilt-edged. 
Top 10 female amateur golfers in the world are (first column is this week's ranking; second column is the previous week's ranking): 
 
1 1 Lydia Ko NZL 1818.87  
2 2 Cecilia Cho NZL 1745.28  
3 3 Kim Williams RSA 1667.19  
4 4 Stephanie Meadow IRL 1588.68  
5 5 Austin Ernst USA 1545.00  
6 6 Iliska Verwey RSA 1532.20  
7 7 Leona Maguire IRL 1531.37  
8 8 Ariya Jutanugarn THA 1528.30  
9 9 Erica Popson USA 1483.33  
10 11 Charley Hull ENG 1452.17

                      	 SCOT HENDRY AND DORSET'S DAVIS ARE ABU DHABI WINNNERS
	                       
                           
                        
     
      
	       FROM THE DAILY TELEGRAPH WEBSITE 
Dubai-based Scottish teenager Daniel Hendry beat Jimmy Mullen in a four-hole play-off on a remarkable final day at the Abu Dhabi Junior Golf Championships, while Hayley Davis from Dorset successfully defended her girls' title after making the long trip from Waco, Texas where she is a freshman student at Baylor University. 
Mullen had been the front runner from the outset of the 54-hole boys' tournament over the Abu Dhabi National course. 
With the sun dropping and the pair having already played out an enduring mental test in the final round heat – they both finished at three under 213 - the pair went down the par five 18th four times before Hendry finally prevailed with a birdie to lift his second trophy inside a week. A member of the Emirates Club, Hendry's victory last week in the Rashid Trophy tournament earned him a place in this week's junior event. 
“I kept going on the front nine but it was roller-coaster play,” said Hendry, who is likely to receive a few more offers to join American universities this week - he already has eight to choose from. Hendry originally came from Stirling but moved to the United Arab Emirates when his father's job took him to the Middle East. 
Hendry, who has a +3 handicap, has played for Scotland in the boys home internationals of 2010 and 2011. 
“We both played great and I think it deserved a play-off like that. It was great experience for the two of us and it felt like we had been out there all day.”  
At halfway, Hendry, who started the day two shots behind, had halved the deficit before striking a superb pitch to the 10th. Mullen, meanwhile, kept himself alive with two notable bunker shots in a row from the 14th.  
When Mullen three-putted the final two holes, enabling the chasing Hendry  to force the play-off, the balance in power shifted in the Scot's favour. Both still had chances to win after finally avoiding safety and going for the 18th in two. Both had their chances on the green, but Mullen ultimately left himself too much to do with the putter. 
After such an enduring battle, the Royal North Devon junior looked utterly dejected. “I should have won,” he conceded. “I hit 15 greens but finished two over par. My bunker play was great but I had too many putts." 
Despite his closing 74, Mullen showed enough talent, especially from the bunkers, to suggest he has a bright future in the game. The 18-year-old now flies to Australia in December where he starts work as a greenkeeper at Riversdale Golf Club in Melbourne. A European Tour card remains his aspiration.  
As Scot Andrew Coltart, a former Ryder Cup player  - part-time on tour and out here engaging in coaching clinics - put it afterwards: “There’s so much pressure in a Championship finale. It’s what you learn from moments like this that define you as a golfer. The sooner Jimmy gets used to it the better it will be.”  
If the relief was palpable for the composed Hendry spare a thought for his parents, who were visibly moved at the denouement. “We were nervous wrecks,” said Andy, his father. “But it shows just how mature he is to win against the cream of British golf.”  
The girls’ event looked to be heading the same way at the turn. In another see-saw encounter, Lauren Taylor from Rugby, at 16 the youngest-ever British women's amateur champion this year, closed the deficit to one stroke before Hayley Davis crucially found her rhythm to retain her title by six shots.  
The Woburn junior’s putting deserted her and she finished one over for the tournament. However it was Davis’s 64 in the second round which proved the difference.  
“I didn’t play great and it was very up and down,” said Davis of her final round 73, who now ends her junior career with back-to-back titles. “I was trying to get a good rhythm and it felt good to come back at one under.”  
After winning the English girls’ trophy this year, Davis, English women's champion the year before, received a congratulatory letter from Peter Allis, who is a member at Davis’s club at Ferndown in Dorset. Following the size of her win here, she can expect more of the same. 
Davis, Taylor and Boulden are all expected to be named in the GB and I preliminary squad for next June's Curtis Cup match at Nairn against the United States.

	       Woburn Golf Club member Lauren Taylor from Rugby, at 16 the youngest ever winner of the British women's open amateur golf championship at Royal Portrush GC, Northern Ireland last June, is on the shortleet of 10 contenders for the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year Award. 
Liam Broady (tennis), Sally Brown (athletics), Tom Daley (diving), Lucy Garner (cycling), Jack Laugher (diving), Pat McCormack (boxing), Laura Robson (tennis), Eleanor Simmonds (swimmin), Lauren Taylor (golf) and Anthony (Rugby Union)  have all made the short list and one of them will be crowned 2011 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year, at the awards show on December 22. 
The accolade, which is awarded by the BBC in partnership with the Youth Sport Trust, is decided by a panel chaired by BBC Sport presenter John Inverdale. 
The panel also included BBC Sport presenters Jake Humphrey, Ore Oduba, Sonali Shah and previous Young Sports Personality of the Year winner Amy Spencer.  
Together, they worked through a huge list of contenders to pick the top 10. All of the young hopefuls have either achieved international success at junior level, or have performed supremely well for their age at senior level.  
Past winners of the Young Sports Personality trophy include Tom Daley, Wayne Rooney, Andy Murray and Eleanor Simmonds. 
There will be questionnaires with each contender available on the BBC Sport website over the coming days, done by BBC School Reporters from Hamble Community Sports College in Southampton.

	       FROM THE DAILY TELEGRAPH WEBSITE 
By Rod Gilmour in Abu Dhabi 
Hayley Davis produced one of the finest rounds in the history of the Junior Golf Championship after an effortless 64 left her within touching distance of back-to-back titles ahead of the final round in Abu Dhabi.  
Following her opening round 74, the current English girls’ champion, pictured right by Cal Carson Golf Agency in her England international uniform, turned the tables with a wonderful display of attacking golf to record a women's course record. Moreover, Davis, who attends Baylor University in Texas, opened up a four-shot gap at the top of the girls’ leaderboard after carding nine birdies and one bogey.  
The boys’ event is a far tighter affair and set for a head-to-head tussle between Jimmy Mullen, at five under par, and Scoland's UAE-based Daniel Hendry, two shorts adrift.  
The day, though, belonged to Davis. The 18-year-old from Dorset went out in 33 while her bludgeoning of the Abu Dhabi National started at the eighth, mustering six birdies in seven holes during a memorable purple patch before returning in 31.  
It evoked memories of Tom Lewis’s round of the same score in 2009 which left him seven shots clear of the field. Lewis, a revelation at this year’s Open at Royal St George’s, finished second that year as Chris Lloyd managed to claw back the deficit through two rounds.  
Davis’s nearest challengers are the impressive youngest ever British women's champion, Lauren Taylor from Rugby and professional's daughter Amy Boulden from Llandudno, North Wales whose 74 was a far cry from her opening 69 in the 54-hole stroke-play event.  
“I hit the ball really good and putted nicely too,” said Davis, who plays at Ferndown in Dorset, the home club of Peter Allis. Regardless to say, the BBC commentator will no doubt be keeping one eye on events today.  
She added: “I’ve had a few 66s before but never shot lower than that so I’m really happy, especially as I only birdied one of the par fives out there.”  
She made up for her long-hole disappointments with a sizzling array of precision golf elsewhere. Her highlights included a 40-footer on the 13th and an up-and-down save for par on 17.  
Davis found herself with breathing space when Boulden fluffed her approach chip into the bunker at the last. She left her next short on the green and finished with a bogey and a disappointing 76. Taylor carded a 71 for the second day running to lie second.  
Davis admitted that the leading group’s form “kept all of us going”.  
“There are low scores to be had out there and it is still all to play for,” she said. “I was five shots off the pace at the start so anything can happen.”  
The calibre of the girls’ play was highlighted at the par three 12th when the leading six all birdied in succession.  
Meanwhile Mullen, fast becoming one of the "finds" of the Championship, leads the 12-boy field by two shots from Scots-born Hendry. Both have played consistently over 36 holes and if yesterday was anything to go by, it will be the putter that wins the day for one of them.  
“I played pretty similar to my opening round,” said the Devon junior, who recorded a two under par 70. “I kept missing short putts and must have shaded three inside five feet today. Dan was doing the same and one of us could easily have been four shots clear.”  
Oliver Carr did well to remain in the hunt. The Wirral junior was five over par for four holes but clicked when it mattered and gleaned four birdies in his last 12 to bridge the gap to within four strokes of Mullen.  
Meanwhile, Luke Fitzpatrick had a day to forget. The Stoke Park golfer scored -six-under-par  to qualify to get here but was left visibly frustrated at the way he fell to +17 on the course.

FROM THE DAILY TELEGRAPH WEBSITE 
By Rod Gilmour in Abu Dhabi 
Amy Boulden, who last year became one of the youngest players to qualify for the Women’s British Open at Carnoustie, hit the first tee shot of the day before topping the girls’ leaderboard by two shots after a fine opening 69 in the Abu Dhabi Junior Championship.  
Boulden’s group took only four hours to race through 18 holes in searing temperatures at the Abu Dhabi National. And for much of the day Llandudno-born Boulden outshone many of the boys until Jimmy Mullen, playing in the last boys’ group of the day, birdied the 18th to match the Welsh teenager at three under par in the boys' event.  
She looked at ease throughout, perhaps aided by the fact that her sister Kim works at the course in a golf teaching post. The 18-year-old Amy came out to the UAE to train for two months in January and February and her hard work certainly paid off.  
Lauren Taylor (Woburn), the youngest ever winner of the British women's open amateur championship at Royal Portrush, Northern Ireland last June, carded a 71 to lie second.  
Boulden, whose father works as a golf pro at Maesdu GC, Llandudno in North Wales, bogeyed the first “from nowhere” but steadied her nerve from the fifth onwards to fire three birdies in seven holes.  
“My pitching let me down today which was disappointing,” she admitted afterwards. “But I’ve been going through some swing changes [like many of the competing juniors at this time of year] so hopefully I can remain consistent this week.”  
Mullen’s only blemish, meanwhile, came courtesy of a double bogey on the par four 14th. He was in good company, though, as the hole proved the most difficult of the day following two sevens from the girls.  
At that hole, Mullen, who seemed to be in aggressive mood throughout his round, found water on the right, subsequently tried playing from the mud before “piling it into a bunker”. He hit the face of the trap and two-putted but maintained his composure to finish with a birdie for a fine 69.  
The lanky two handicapper said confidently: “The wind was swirling the whole time and it was hard to guess. But I have been playing well this week and now have a great chance. If I carry on playing like I did today then I don’t think anyone will catch me.”  
The 17-year-old, who plays at Royal North Devon, leads by one from Daniel Hendry. The Scot resides in the United Arab Emirates and came into the tournament on the back of a local tournament win at the weekend. Hendry led for most of the day, too, until Mullen’s last hole exploits.  
Heswall’s Oliver Carr, one of the favourites this week, lies a further shot back following a composed 71.  
Despite a flurry of nervous faces on the first tee yesterday, Jack Singh Brar, who turned 15 last Friday and is the youngest player in both fields, looked unfazed. The Hampshire junior hit a booming opening drive before finishing with a 77. “I just couldn’t hole the putts today,” he said. He’s still to one to watch whatever happens this week.  
Mullen’s county team-mate Oliver Walsh found conditions tough going and carded 13 over par. “Well, that didn’t go quite according to plan,” said the Thurlston member. He blamed himself for not drinking enough water. But that’s all part of the experience that this tournament yields.  
This year’s competition, supported by The Daukt Telegraph, is rightly seen as one of the strongest ever fields, in an event which was first staged in 1985 at the Belfry.  
Eight boys and four girls arrived here with handicaps of plus-two or better and a wealth of international experience. Such is the talent, it’s hard to predict which two will walk away as champions.

LANARKSHIRE HONOURS MAY HUGHES 
  
      ?  Long-playing Lanark Golf Club member May Hughes received Honorary Membership of the county at the AGM. This was the speech given by county captain Lesley Lloyd when making the presentation:  "May Hughes has been a member of LLCGA since 1979 and played for the County Team between 1983 and 2010.  May was selected for this year’s team but decided it was time to hang up her red jersey.    During that time, especially in the 1980s and early 1990s, Lanarkshire were a very successful team and May was part of a winning team that qualified for and won the Scottish County Finals on 4 occasions.     May was County Champion in 1993, 2003 & 2004 and runner-up on 3 other occasions.  As well as being a very successful golfer, May served on Committee from 1996-99 and she was County Captain in 2008 and 2009 in our Centenary Year.    Since becoming eligible for Seniors and Vets golf May has twice been West of Scotland Vets Champion in 2008 and 2010, was runner up in the Scottish Vets Championship in 2010, represented the Scottish Vets Team on five occasions and this year represented Scotland in the Senior Home International Matches.    May, in recognition of your outstanding contribution and commitment to Lanarkshire Ladies County Golf Association over many years I would ask you to accept Honorary membership of our Association."        Labels:  Amateur Ladies

THREE-ROUND STROKE-PLAY 
 
By COLIN FARQUHARSON 
 Colin@scottishgolfview.com  
Most golfing federations - like the rest of us - don't have money to burn, but France could be the exception. 
They have sent seven lady amateurs to Florida to play in a number of events on the Suncoast Ladies Series professional circuit.  
The cost of the flights, food and acccomodation, not to mention tournament entry fees, for seven ladies over a few weeks in Florida would amount to a few thousand dollars. 
But the French Federation will think it cheap at the price if they can win not only next July's European ladies team championship but also the ladies' world amateur team championship for the Espirito Santo Trophy, to be played at Antalya Golf Club, Turkey next September. 
Money can never buy you guaranteed success in golf but it can go a long way towards it if the talent is there in the first place!

	   Catriona Matthew saved her best to last - and a four-under-par 68 lifted her from T43 to joint 26th in the final placings of the LPGA Tour event, the CME Group Titleholders at Grand Cypress Resort, Orlando, Florida today. 
The North Berwick player, winner of the Lorena Ochoa Invitational the previous weekend in Mexico, took a while to get the competitive juices flowing again but after improving rounds of 76, 75 and 74, the Scot produced one of the lowest rounds of the final day to boost her cash prize to $10,123. 
England's Karen Stupples finished on the same mark with scores of 71, 75, 73 and 74. 
First time winner after four years on the LPGA Tour was South Korean Hee Young Park with scores of 71, 69, 69 and 70 for a nine-under-par total of 279 which earned her $500,000. 
Sandra Gal (Germany), who had been joint leader overnight, dropped down to a share of second place on 281 with American Paula Creamer. Both earned $95,516. Sandra shot 69, 69, 71 and 72; Paula 69, 71, 71 and 70.

Suzann Petersen (Norway) is poised in third place, only a shot behind the pacemaking duo. Suzann, like Catriona, is improving with every round - 73-69-68 for 210. 
England's Karen Stupple is T23 on 219 with scores of 71, 75 and 73.

	   SUNDAY MORNING NEWS: Ciganda beat Tvede in play-off to score first win as a professional. 
 
FROM THE LETAS WEBSITE 
After both shooting 70 in the final round of the Murcia Ladies Open to finish at five under par 214, the defending champion Julie Tvede from Denmark and Spain’s Carlota Ciganda will resume play on Sunday morning.  
The two players played the par five 18th twice in the play-off, both recording birdies each time but were unable to continue due to darkness. 
Ciganda and Tvede both started the day at 2 under par, one shot behind the overnight leader, impressive young Danish amateur, Daisy Nielsen. Tvede was the strongest of the three players over the opening nine, recording a 3 under 34, with four birdies and one bogey.  
Ciganda started slowly with two bogeys in her first eight holes but jump-started her round with an eagle at the 498-yard par 5 ninth hole.  
Nielsen covered the front nine in one under par but faltered on the back to shoot 75 and finish at 1 under par in fourth. It was a solid performance from Spain’s Maria Beautell who shot a final round of 71 to finish in third place.  
Play will resume at 8.15 am.  
Heather MacRae (Gleneagles) was the top Scot, finishing T9 on 223 with scores of 76, 70 and 77. She had a double bogey 6 at the 15th for the second successive day. Heather's take-home pay amounted to 675 Euros. 
British amateur international Pamela Pretswell (Bothwell Castle), who entered the tournament because it was being played over La Manga's South Course which is the same one that will be used for January's LET Qualifying School, finished one shot behind Heather but T17 was her final position after rounds of 73, 75 and 76. She had a birdie 3 at the 14th in the final round. The same hole cost her a double bogey 6 in the first round.

                      	 DEATH OF MOIRA THOMSON (61) SHOCKS SCOTTISH GOLF
	                       
                           
                        
     
      
	      By GILLIAN KIRKWOOD It is with great sadness and  regret that I report the death of Moira Thomson (nee Dewar) at the young age of 61.    
She died this morning (19th November) at the Western General Hospital.   I am sure all who read this will be as shocked as I am at the speed in which her illness took her.   It has been only 13 weeks since her diagnosis,  and she fought a courageous battle to the end. 
Moira won the Scottish Girls Championship at Dalmahoy in 1968.   Starting out as a County player for Midlothian, and then a stalwart of the East Lothian County team,  she really came into her own on reaching the age for seniors golf,  and was a regular Scottish Senior International player for over 10 years.    
She worked very hard on her golf in these latter years,  and gained the respect of her international colleagues as a strong match player.  She thoroughly enjoyed the camaraderie of senior golf and her  friends at Gullane will miss her in their regular Saturday game. 
Our heartfelt sympathies go to her husband Alastair, her daughter Claire and son Andrew, her sister Anne and their families. 
Funeral arrangements will be announced later.

	   Catriona Matthew is lying joint 47th in this weekend's LPGA Tour event, the CME Group Titleholders (surely the worst named tournament in recent times), at Grand Cypress Resort, Florida. 
The North Berwick  player, winner of the Lorena Ochoa Invitational in Mexico last week, has shot 76 and 75 for 151.

   The second round of the 54-hole Murcia Ladies Open over the South Course, La Manga will be completed early Saturday morning after electrical storms in the south-east region of Spain forced a  suspension of play this afternoon.  Heather MacRae (Gleneagles) and amateur international Pamela Pretswell (Bothwell Castle) will have nine holes to complete before going out again for the third and final round.  They are both two over par overall, Pretswell, playing the second nine first, dropped three shots over her first three holes. MacRae started badly but birdied the fourth, sixth and eighth before play was halted.  Ayrshire's Pamela Feggans also has nine holes to complete but, having run up a quadruple bogey 8 at the third and taken 44 shots for the first nine to be 12 over par overall, she has little chance of surving the cut, forecast to be at four-over 150.  Carnoustie's Katy McNicoll was one of the few to complete her second round and she had a disastrous 83 with one triple boge3y and two double bogeys to be joint 66th on 159.   Danish amateur Daisy Nielsen, with nine holes to play, leads at three under par by one shot from Danielle McVeigh (Ireland), also halfway through her second round, with overnight leader Carlota Ciganda (Spain) one under par with six holes to play.

DAYTONA BEACH, Florida — LPGA Commissioner Michael Whan and Symetra Financial Corporation CEO Tom Marra today announced that Symetra, a Bellevue, Washington-based provider of employee benefits, annuities and life insurance, has signed a multi-year agreement securing the naming rights for the Symetra Tour (formerly known as the LPGA Futures Tour).

British amateur international Pamela Pretswell from Hamilton and Carnoustie-based tour professional Katy McNicoll are in the top 10 after the first round of the Murcia Ladies Open at La Manga, Spain. 
Pretswell, retaining her amateur status until she sees how she fares at the Ladies European Tour Qualifying School over the same course in early January, and McNicoll both matched the par of 73. 
They are joint eighth in a field of 82 players, five shots behind the 21-year-old Spanish leader, Carlota Ciganda, a rookie pro from the bull-run city of Pamplona. 
Pretswell would have been at least two shots closer but for a double bogey 6 at the 14th. Pamela, 21, had a mid-round slump when she dropped four shots between the ninth and 15th but she had started well with birdies at the third and long fourth.  
The Glasgow University graduate and Bothwell Castle GC member also finished strongly with birdies at the 16th and long 18th in halves of 36-37. 
Former North of Scotland amateur champion McNicoll did all her good work over the first nine holes with birdies at the par-4 third and then three long holes, the fourth, sixth and ninth. Her outward half of four-under 33 was one of the best of the day but she gave it all back with a double bogey at the 14th and bogeys at the 11th and 14th in 40 for the second nine. 
Dunblane's Heather MacRae, playing out of Gleneagles Hotel), is sharing 21st place after a two-over-par 75 (37-38) which included a double bogey 7 at the long fourth and a weak finish with bogeys at the 14th, 15th and 18th. But she did birdie the two early short holes, the second and fifth, and also the eighth and long 13th. 
Pamela Feggans, from Patna, Ayrshire, is back in joint 58th place after a 78 which included a double bogey 5 at the short 12th and bogeys at five other holes. Her two birdies came at long holes, the sixth and 18th, in halves of 38-40.

                      	 MERGER BETWEEN EWGA AND EGU COMES INTO EFFECT ON JAN 1
	                       
                           
                        
     
      
	   NEWS RELEASE ISSUED BY THE ENGLISH WOMEN'S GOLF ASSOCIATIONThe merger of the English Golf Union (EGU) and the English Women’s Golf Association (EWGA) was approved yesterday at simultaneous general meetings of both organisations.  
The merger will come into effect on January 1 and will create England Golf, one national governing body to represent all amateur golfers in England.  
The merger proposal was approved by 86 per cent of the voting members of the EGU, meeting at its headquarters in Woodhall Spa; and by 100 per cent of the voting members of the EWGA, meeting at the National Motor Cycle Museum at Solihull. Both organisations had to approve the proposal by a majority of at least 75 per cent for it to be successful.  
The decision was immediately hailed as a triumph for golf and a vital step forward for the game.  
Sylvia Perrins, EWGA Interim Chairman, and Nigel Evans, the EGU Chairman, said: “This merger is in the best interests of golf and we are delighted that it has been given overwhelming support by our members. We look forward to a new era and to realising our vision for the future. 
“England Golf will speak with one voice and send out the powerful, modern message that golf is a game for all, for men and women, boys and girls. 
“A unified organisation, which promotes both the men’s and women’s game, will be more attractive to new golfers, will help us to grow the game, will be more appealing to commercial partners and sponsors and will mean we can be more cost effective.” 
The merger vote followed a long period of consultation and preparation, which began in 2009 when a steering group was formed of members of both organisations. 
Following lengthy discussions, and the involvement of ten working groups, the proposal was produced and ratified by the Boards of both organisations before being put to the voting members. 
Key points of the merger 
• The headquarters of England Golf will initially be at the National Golf Centre at Woodhall Spa. The EWGA offices in Edgbaston will continue in use until at least October 2012.  
• The counties will continue to be the voting members. Counties will be encouraged to merge their Unions and Associations, but this will not be mandatory. 
• The Board of England Golf will initially include 10 stakeholder non-executive directors, six nominated by the EGU and four women nominated by the EWGA. One of these 10 will be nominated as Chairman. 
• The first sole President of England Golf will be a woman. The President will be supported by the immediate Past President and the President-Elect. One of these three will always be a woman.  
• Club golf will go on, from day-to-day, as it does now, but members will benefit from the positive perceptions created by the merger and by the better support available for clubs.  
• All the championships and tournaments currently run by the EWGA and the EGU will continue. 
• The regional and group structures of the two organisations will continue to run competitions. The decision-making role of the EWGA regional committees will end. 
• Affiliation fees for men and women will be harmonised and will be equal by  January 1, 2014. Women will continue to pay an additional subscription to the Ladies Golf Union.

  Elizabeth Mallett signs a Letter of Intent to join the University of North Carolina in August next year.  
NEWS RELEASE ISSUED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA 
England golf international Sutton Coldfield teenage golfer Elizabeth Mallett has accepted an offer and has signed a National Letter of Intent for a golf scholarship to join The University of North Carolina women’s golf team.  
The signing ends a busy period of negotiation for the 17 year old Elizabeth where she has been considering several options and finally secures her four- year placement at UNC that will begin in August 2012. 
The 2010 English Girls Champion explained “It’s been the most important golfing decision I’ve had to make in my career to date. Not so much about my golfing journey continuing over in America, as I made that part of the decision some time ago that my future would involve playing and competing in the US - but because I’ve had four other great written offers to consider to join other US universities on the table in the last couple of weeks.  
"They were all highly valuable offers with slightly differing strengths and emphasis to them, so it’s been a difficult choice to make “ 
Elizabeth recently flew over to America on an official short trip visit to some of the possible university options and meet both their golf coaches and university academic advisors about her future. 
Elizabeth enthused, “It was my first time in America and it was a great experience to see it for myself. Each university really gave me the red carpet treatment which made me realise how serious a commitment the university make when taking on a new recruit.  
"I was taken out for breakfast meetings, lunch appointments and had dinner with the other team members, visited local sights as well as being shown the university campus and golfing facilities. They were all really impressive“ 
As part of the ongoing decision making process, Elizabeth has recently had to sit the SAT academic exam in early October to fulfil US university entrance eligibility which opened up the way for the offers - as the four-year scholarship is dependent on Elizabeth maintaining her academic level for her degree course as well as her ongoing golfing commitments. 
In reasoning her choice Elizabeth added “ My search has been to seek out my best option and I finally decided that UNC would set challenging demands for me both on the golf course as well as in the classroom. The university has fantastic golfing facilities and a proven coaching system and so it’s a real honour for me to join their program. I have a lot to learn about American conditions so am quite excited about the challenges ahead. “ 
Jan Mann, the head women’s golf coach at UNC, said “We are excited that Elizabeth has chosen to attend Carolina and join the UNC women’s golf program. Her junior success speaks for itself. Elizabeth has a proven track record not only in England but an international level. She will bring a great deal of depth to the team, we are looking forward to Elizabeth joining our Carolina family “ 
+Elizabeth, who was only 15 when she reached the final of the British girls' open championship at West Lancs GC in 2009 before losing to France's Perrine Delacour, was a member of the title-winning England team at the Girls' Home Internationals at Gullane last August   Labels:  US COLLEGES

From Blackburn, England, she was a member of the 2011 Girls International Matches Championship team and, as an individual, won the Leveret Trophy Championship with a 136 (68-68).
