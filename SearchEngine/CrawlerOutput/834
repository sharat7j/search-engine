 Tiger Woods    Swing Sequence 
by Simon Holmes 
 
The biggest change in golf instruction over 
the last 50 years has been the video camera. 
One of Ben Hogan’s regrets was that 
he only worked on what he thought he 
did, not what he actually did. Thanks to 
modern technology, you have the reality 
at your fingertips. 
   You are about to study the 
swing of the world’s No.1 player, Tiger 
Woods. It’s a swing of sheer athletic 
power and poise. Use these still images 
to get a picture in your mind of the key 
positions that you can try to copy to 
build a chain-reaction of your own: a consistent 
swing that will reward you with 
more solid ball-striking. 
 One of the secrets to getting better 
and practising effectively is that you 
rehearse one or two simple things a 
thousand times - and not a thousand different 
things once! Pay particular attention 
to the set-up, the takeaway and the 
top of the backswing positions, all of 
which are clearly related in a wonderful 
chain of motion. Use a video to check on 
your progress as often as you can. That 
way you will be aware of any unconscious 
changes that may creep in (and 
which otherwise would go undetected). 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  Perfect Address  
 This angle is called the 
'down the line’ view and 
we use it to analyse the 
geometry of the golf swing - i.e. 
the posture, the body angles and 
the plane (or inclination) of the 
swing. Because the golf swing 
starts at what is essentially a static 
position, good balance at address 
is vital. Tiger sets his lower body 
perfectly. Notice how he keeps his 
hips 'on top’ of the balls of his feet, 
which means his lower body is in a 
perfect position to store the power 
of his turn. Because his lower body 
is so balanced, he can naturally set 
his back and neck in a textbook 
neutral position. 
Take as much from this image as 
you possibly can, and rehearse 
your posture in front of a mirror.  
  The  Takeaway  
 There are two key things 
to observe in Tiger’s takeaway. 
The first is that he 
displays no independent hand or 
arm motion. The 'engine’ controlling 
the takeaway is clearly his 
torso, with his left arm working 
across the chest. The second key 
is that his shoulders are turning 
exactly on plane - i.e. at 90 
degrees to his spine angle. 
Tiger has improved this position a 
great deal, and we can see how 
square the clubface is as the shaft 
approaches a position horizontal to 
the ground. Tiger used to get the 
clubface pointing more down 
towards the ground at this 
stage (i.e. 'shut’), but now,working 
on an improved plane, and with 
good rotation in his arms and torso, 
he has changed for the better.  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  Halfway Back  
 I see a huge difference in 
this position from years 
gone by. The club shaft is 
now working up on a much shallower 
plane and the right elbow 
and left elbow are now more or 
less level. This has been the result 
of Hank Haney’s work and Tiger 
believes he has more stability in 
his swing and therefore more controlled 
power. 
As per the graphic, we can see 
that Tiger is swinging the club 
more on one plane, the shaft at 
this stage clearly relating to the 
angle of the shaft at the set-up. 
The red line we have superimposed 
here illustrates where he 
used to be - a much steeper 
backswing plane. So we can 
see that Tiger has made 
huge changes in his 
technique.  
  Top of the Backswing  
 Tiger’s arm plane is flatter 
than it once was,more 
level with the shoulders, 
while the position of the right arm 
has changed drastically. During the 
Butch Harmon years, Tiger’s arm 
plane was steeper than his shoulder 
plane. This got Tiger’s right 
arm more in front of his right 
shoulder at the top of the backswing, 
which gave him a steeper 
angle of attack but did keep his 
arms in front of his body. 
The coil of the body is just so 
perfect: in balance, on plane 
totally wound up. Another benefit 
from Hank Haney’s work is the 
square clubface, matching up with 
the angle of the left forearm.  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  The Transition 
 Here we can see the real 
athleticism of Tiger, and 
the benefit of all those 
hours in the gym. He is strong 
enough to be able to start his 
left hip rotating back towards 
the target while keeping his 
back facing the target.  
 This 
guarantees a perfect delivery 
position - and some serious 
speed. This is all about 
mobility, stability and strength. 
Get in the gym!  
  The Delivery  
 Just try getting your 
hips this open with your 
shoulders that shut. 
Wow! Here is a serious athlete 
showing us his moves. The shaft 
plane is releasing down the 
right forearm and Tiger is rotating 
extremely hard with his core. 
One of the things I feel he will 
improve in the future is that gap 
between his left arm and the left 
side of his chest. I think he will 
gradually also stay a little taller 
through the ball, which will help 
him to maintain the 'connection’ 
between the upper left arm and 
the left side of the chest.  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  The 'Exit’ 
 The shaft now exits 
on plane, which 
means no hands-flip 
through impact, and - especially 
for Tiger - lower 
hands through impact. 
Tiger’s Achilles heel will forever 
be high hands through 
impact caused from that 
separation of the left arm 
away from the body as he 
drives and unwinds (see 
frame 6). High hands with 
lots of power means lost 
shots to the right, or a shut 
clubface - two bad misses. 
Tiger has improved this and 
he continues to progress.  
  The Finish 
 The only 
thing to 
copy here is 
the balance. Never 
swing harder or 
faster than you can 
stay in balance at 
the finish. It will be 
fun to see how 
Tiger improves in 
the future, and to 
see his swing 
changes. One 
thing’s for sure: he 
is getting better. 
Scary, hey?
