     Why can't we remember things as a baby? I would love to know why we dont? 
 Also what do babies dream about?

       its called childhood amnesia! it seems the "memory making" parts of an infant are underdeveloped.....scientists are yet to find out why. 
and about the babies dreaming....we may never know. all we know right know that infants MAY dream twice than what adults dream.
