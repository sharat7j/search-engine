 Vaughn Snyder of Massillon advanced through the first stage of PGA Tour Qualifying School ‘on the number’ last Friday, finishing in a tie for the final spot at 6-under 282 at  Grasslands Golf & Country Club, Lakeland, FL . 
 Brian Unk of Lewis Center easily made it through his first stage test, finishing T10 after shooting 289 (+1) in windy conditions at  Deerwood Golf Club in Kingwood, TX . 
 And former Kent State player John Hahn of Hudson, now living full time in Las Vegas, tied for fourth place at 284 (-4) to advance from the qualifier at  Pinewild Country Club in Pinehurst, NC . 
 While Snyder, Unk and Hahn will move on to second stage events in mid-November, other local players who also tested the Q-School waters did not fare as well. [NEWLY UPDATED] 
 Blake Sattler of New Philadelphia (left) may have had the toughest week; he finished his first stage tournament at 1-under par 287 and missed advancing by just a single shot at  Stonebridge Ranch in McKinney, TX . 
 In the same Grasslands event in which Snyder played, Garrett Frank of Youngstown failed to advance, finishing with a score of 291 (+3) to finish 45th. 
 Christopher Capriolo of Medina missed advancing, posting 297 (+9) to finish T63 at  Dayton Valley Golf Club in Dayton, NV . 
 Tim Ailes of Lewis Center  missed advancing from the first stage qualifier at  Lantana Golf Club in Lantana, TX  which completed play on October 28th, posting a 72-hole score of 291 (+3) to finish tied for 43rd place. 
 And finally, Nick Latimer of Brooklyn finished with a score of 300 (+12) to finish T65 after a tough closing round at the qualifier at  Kinderlou Forest Golf Club in Valdosta, CA . 
 Northeast Ohio Golf will track local players in the second stage of Q-School in mid-November as well; keep watching…
