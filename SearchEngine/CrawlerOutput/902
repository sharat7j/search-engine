Reliable problem solving in all subjects that use mathematics for problem solving. Algebra, Physics, Chemistry... from grade school to grad school and beyond.
		 
 
 
	 For Windows users,  NuCalc 2.0  (The Graphing Calculator
                       for Windows)  includes capabilities similar to SureMath. 
 
 
 
 
 Only identify what is asked for. Ignore all the ifs, ands and buts.... 
 A problem is understood by solving it not by pondering it.

						There is a urgent need to replace the many problem solving schemes that have been randomly introduced in K-12 math education in recent years with processes based on sound use of mathematics.
					 
	
				 
				 
					 
						Both Benjamin Bloom's Taxonomy  1

						are well represented in the problem solutions and the descriptions of the problem solving process. 
						 
						The free website  Ms. Lindquist: The Algebra word Problem Tutor  provides a valuable resource for exercise in handling story problems. The program was developed by Neil Heffernan at Carnegie Mellon University.
