           Climate and Atmospheric Research 
           The Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE)  partners with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's  Atmospheric  Turbulence and Diffusion Division (ATDD)  to conduct climate research focused on  issues of national and global importance. 
         
           Research is performed with personnel support from ORISE’s   Independent Environmental Assessment and Verification (IEAV)  programs, as well  as in collaboration with scientists and engineers from  Oak Ridge National  Laboratory (ORNL) , and numerous other organizations, government agencies,  universities and private research institutions. 
                   ATDD's objectives include: 
         
           Developing better methods for predicting  transport and dispersion of air pollutants. 
           Collecting high-quality measurements and  improving the modeling of air-surface exchange of water, energy and carbon, so  that their effect(s) on the earth's climate may be better understood. 
           Installing and maintaining a long-term,  self-consistent system to monitor climate across the United States (see the   Climate Reference Network ).
