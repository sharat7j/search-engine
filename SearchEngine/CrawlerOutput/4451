						  Population Effect On Global Warming  
						  We’ve already looked at the greenhouse effect and the basic concepts behind global warming. We’ve also in the past mentioned that the general view both in the media and by most global warming think tanks is that global warming is a human problem and one that rests squarely on the shoulders of every human being alive today

						  10 Ways To Save Energy  
						  In this article we look at things we can do to help stop global warming. As individuals reducing the amount of carbon emission we’re responsible for (i.e. our carbon footprint) can and will go along way towards saving our planet. 
 
                        
                    
                        
                        
                        
					 
					
			 
	
						
			 
			
            
            
            	
					 
						 					 
                    
                                   
					
										
					 
						  Global Warming & Animal Extinction  
						  Whilst hunting and habitat destruction play a major part in animal extinction there’s no doubt that the effects associated with climate change such as higher temperatures, extreme weather, changing rainfall all make the situation even worse.

                	   Rachel Dawes  :  Lovely pictures, really found the Diesel ones to be cool! 
	   Stop Killing Tigers  :  Amit, I take it you’re from India, why don’t you stop killing tigers ? They’re gonna get extinct. That’s what you can do to help! 
	   Zohaib  :  We can also grow plants. They will look beautiful and will help the environment. 
	   Zohaib  :  I think we can’t do anything right now. What we can do later is use solar powered cars which are eco- friendly. That’ll reduce air pollution.
