      Martin Kaymer still won’t follow McIlroy, Westwood to PGA Tour           By       Jay Busbee  
               
              
              
               
                The PGA Tour, she's a patient temptress. Oh, you may make all kinds of noises about how you don't need her, you don't want her, you'll be just fine without her ... but eventually, you'll be looking for her approval. Count  Rory McIlroy  and  Lee Westwood  among the number of European players who have made noises about remaining on the far side of the pond but succumbing to temptation 
  Martin Kaymer  has already announced that  he won't be pursuing PGA Tour membership . And over the weekend at the Omega Mission Hills World Cup, he raised an eyebrow at the actions of his fellow worldbeaters. 
 "I just don't know why Rory and Lee go back and forth, and that to me seems a little strange," Kaymer said. "One year they are on the PGA Tour and next they're not. But it's  their decisions and they can make up their own minds." 
 For his part, Kaymer noted that the travel and minimum-play requirements for both tours -- 12 for Europe and 15 for the PGA Tour -- are just too prohibitive. Of course, Westwood said the same thing too ... once. 
 So, sit tight there, Mr. 2010-PGA-Championship champ. When you're ready, the PGA Tour will be waiting for you.

Your sponsors are european base plus US golf will continue to pop the european hot air balloons any where in the world. It's very smart for Rory and Lee to rejoin the PGA tour with Luke Donald because they will make more money in US on top of TV exposure for their global sponsors. Isn't that what you are supposed to do?

Seven events count on both tours (the 4 majors and 3 WGC), which means you need five more for European Tour membership and eight more for PGATour membership.   My addition yields a total of 20 events per year, which is well under the number that most pros play each year (usually 25, give or take).   Travel is a legitimate issue, but not the number of tournaments.

                    2 users disliked this comment    Defiance    10 hours ago   Report Abuse    Kaymer has the right to choose where he wants to play. In fact, playing on the Euro Tour, despite giving less prize money than the PGA, is NOT actually worse than the PGA. In fact ,the European Tour courses are set up much more difficult than the PGA course setups so that's why a lot of great PGA Tour players don't do so well in the majors but a lot of European Tour players play very well in the majors. In fact, 6 of the previous 7 Major Championship winners came from the Euro Tour, with the lone exception being Bradley at the PGA.

I know I wouldn't, so I don't blame him for staying on the European tour.

Purses on the PGA Tour are often double and triple what they are on other world tours.    The weather is a lot better too without fluke conditions that can change in minutes.    Travel is also much easier as you are in the same country, all the time.    Plus, the women look a lot better over here      
 
Seems like a lot of pretty @#$% good reasons to me

Luke had 2 plus 2 on the PGA tour.   Luke is making them look foolish. I suppose they thought they could stay over there and clean up.   Folks, the two of them are not finishers.   Furthermore, I think they miss the galleries here in the USA. 
 
BTW: Speaking of purses.   The Fedex Cup Playoffs have a combined purse of $24Million with $10Million for the winner.   The Euro Tour during that same stretch has about $6Million.

I am glad to see that McIlroy and Westwood got smart and opted for the PGA Tour.

Hope all the great players from Europe show up someday. 2012 promises to be an awesome season especially if Tiger and Phil bring some sunshine with their games. I look forward to seeing some intense battles especially in the Ryder Cup. I think we have more than enough talent to get that little beauty to take up residence in the U.S. for a few years.
