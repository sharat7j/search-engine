  Plate Tectonics 
   Earth is an ever-changing planet. Volcanoes and
              earthquakes continually reshape the continents and seafloor. Mountains
            rise, then are worn down.
 
 
 In the 1960s, scientists presented a theory that
              explains Earth's dynamics, from the occurence of earthquakes to
              the building of the Mid-Ocean Ridge.  Explore

From Expedition 7: If you
            drained the water from the ocean basins, some of the most dramatic
            features you would see are groups or lines of underwater volcanoes
            called "seamounts",
sometimes in clusters and other times stretching across the ocean basin for many
miles.  Learn
