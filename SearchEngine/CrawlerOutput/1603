Taking Human Presence to the Unknown World Under the Sea 
   The forbidding conditions in the depths of the sea have kept people mystified about the ocean until modern times. Even as we touch the surface of far off planets, much of the ocean is unknown to us because of its immense size and tremendous depth.  
  Since the 1960’s three basic types of exploration vehicles have been developed, and they all remain in use today. Each type has it own role in ocean research and they often support or complement each other’s capabilities.
