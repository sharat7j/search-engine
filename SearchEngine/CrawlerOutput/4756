I. Science MaTe Curriculum
 

The I. Science MaTe Reference Curriculum uses problem solving and critical thinking techniques in most labs.  Teachers learn the weekly components of the program by reading the Pre Lab, Lab, and Post Lab for the theme of the week.  Teachers learn along with their students if they go through the suggested activities.  As they go through the specific grade they can customize activities to suit their needs and the school's equipment.  
 
 The CD is recommended for teachers and parents with slow internet connections to receive all the benefits of the I. Science MaTe curriculum at home or away.
