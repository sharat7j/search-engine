          Worker Health Studies 
         The  Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE)  supports the  U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE)  commitment to ensuring that all research and production activities at its facilities are performed in a manner that emphasizes worker health and safety.  
         
       The measurement and analysis of occupational-related health issues of DOE workers is critical to  mitigating the causes and effects of on-the-job exposures. Through partnerships with DOE and other federal agencies, ORISE conducts research and performs studies to evaluate occupational exposure and worker health risks at  sites across the nation.  Studies performed for DOE and other federal agencies include: 
         
           DOE Illness and Injury Surveillance  Program (IISP): 14 sites, 125,000 workers 
           DOE Radiation Exposure Monitoring System:  99 sites, more than 500,000 workers 
           DOE Health and Mortality Study: 60 sites,  450,000 workers 
           DOE, Congress-mandated 5 Rem Study: 32  sites, 3,000 workers 
           DOE Beryllium-Associated Worker Registry:  25 sites, approximately 20,000 workers 
           U.S. Nuclear Regulatory  Commission (NRC) Radiation Exposure Information and Reporting System: 1,800+  licensees, more than one million individuals monitored 
         
         ORISE  also performs studies with broader environmental and public health scope. For  example, ORISE collects and analyzes data regarding radioactive materials released from  nuclear power plants for the NRC as part of the Effluent Database for Nuclear Power  Plants.
