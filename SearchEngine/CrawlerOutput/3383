												Bishop, Calif. ? August “Augie” Hess has been playing golf for nearly 50 years. But at age 96, he doesn’t break 90 as often as he used to.

He’s never taken a single lesson and never practices his putting, yet he is a solid 18-handicapper on the 6,200-yard, par 71 course that he first joined in 1964.
