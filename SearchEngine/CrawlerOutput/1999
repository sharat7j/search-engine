					  Mike Armour and Dave Trier Post Big Win at ADGA 2-Man Better Ball  

					 by Allen Freeman  |  May 3, 2009    No Comments  

					 

 The team of Mike Armour and Dave Trier shot a sizzling round of 8-under par 63 to win the ADGA’s 2-player better ball event at Turkeyfoot Golf Links in Akron on Saturday. 
 An eagle at the par-5 16th and six birdies (including a great birdie at the long par-3 15th) against a lone bogey at the par-3 13th gave the Armour/Trier pair a two shot victory over the team of Ryan Maxwell and Ross Beal. 
 In fact, the birdie at 15 and eagle at 16 by Trier and Armour were two of the three skins won, giving them a pretty thorough haul for the day. 
 The next ADGA event will be a 4-man scramble at Brookledge GC in Stow on Saturday, May 16th. To register, visit the  ADGA website  or call the ADGA voicemail at (440) 848-8364 and leave a message.    [Read more ?]  

					 

					   

			

					
			

					  Golf Chatter: Country Club of Ashland Rumor  

					 by Allen Freeman  |  March 23, 2009    No Comments  

					 

 More golf rumors, whispers, innuendos and half-truths: 
 - Add this one to the ‘bogus story’ category: rumors that the Country Club of Ashland is in financial distress and may not open for the 2009 season are FALSE. 
 “I don’t know where these things come from,” sighed Dan Priest, head pro at Ashland. “The club is open, we are still private and expect a great year. The dining room is now open for business to the public, but that has no affect on the club or course. The Ashland Am-Am is on the schedule for June 13-14 and we’re looking forward to it.” 
 Good news for one of the top Northeast Ohio golf tournaments of the summer…

 In windy conditions and battling more than a few tucked pins, the teams of Mike Kracker & Jeff Mallette and John Oyster & John Hahn Jr. tied for the top spot at the 2008 Ashland Am-Am. 
 Each team posted a 6-under par 66 in the two-player better ball format, a solid score based on the setup and conditions. The next closest pursuers finished two back. 
 Thanks to Dan Priest and the rest of the Country Club of Ashland staff for the hospitality, food, and great golf course conditions that the players enjoyed over the past two days. Year after year, a great event.
