     Welcome to the ChefMoz dining guide beta!
 Yes, you can read and write restaurant reviews here, but you'll also find direct links to reviews on other sites.  It's all the work of our volunteer editors, who scour the web to collect restaurant information for you.  We also accept reviews and restaurant information from the public.
