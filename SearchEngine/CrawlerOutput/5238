         The 
          crucial components of "Responsible Gaming": 
         From 
          the gambling venue's point of view, here are nine crucial things that 
          determine whether or not the venue is operating responsibly. Responsible 
          gaming policies are intended to provide guidelines to gaming venues 
          to operate with high ethical standards. Many of the principles listed 
          here will be discussed in more detail in future updates. 
         1. 
          Ensure a secure, fair and safe gaming environment for patrons. 
          2.  
          Protect all patrons from adverse consequences. 
          3.Take measures to address underage and vulnerable players. Identify 
          and block play for underage and/or vulnerable players. Address problem 
          gambling issues and reduce its likelihood. 
          4. Implement anti-money laundering procedures. 
          5. Protect the data and records of patrons. 
          6. Ensure that payments to and from patrons are prompt and accurate. 
          7. Test and verify fair gaming, ensure randomness and rules adherence. 
          8. All marketing materials must be factually correct and do not target 
          those ineligible to gamble. 
          9. Genuine processes should be in place for handling patron complaints 
          and comments.
