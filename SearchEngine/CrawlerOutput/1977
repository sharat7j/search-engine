					 Duda Earns “Fall Tour Triple” with Bailey at Big Met

 Derek Duda of Seven Hills completed the Cleveland Metroparks “Fall Tour Triple Crown” by being a part of the winning team at the Fall Tour 2-Man Scramble at Big Met on Saturday. 
 In chilly and wet conditions, Duda and partner Andrew Bailey shot an 11-under par score of 61 to win by two shots over last year’s Fall 2-Man champions, Brian Smith and Norton Brick. 
 Coming into the Big Met 2-Man, Duda won the 27-hole Bill Barbour Cup at Sleepy Hollow with Doug Barbour as his partner. He then won the 3-Player Scramble at Manakiki while playing with Frank Livak and David Stover. Derek then picked up current Big Met course champion and course-record holder Andrew Bailey as his partner after the event’s cancellation in early October and stormed to a two shot victory and the “elusive triple crown”. 
 It is believed that this is the first time that one player has had a part in winning all three Fall Tour tournaments. 
 Derek has already begun lobbying for a new exemption category for the 2012 Greater Cleveland Amateur. Big Met pro Mike Raby commented, “We don’t give exemptions for winning team events, but this may get some consideration.”
