						  How Do Camels Survive The Desert ?  
						 The body of a camel is so amazingly adapted to survival in the desert that it can with stand even the harshest of desert climates. Their biggest strength has to be their ability to survive without food and water for long periods of time. This unique ability stems from their body being able to store fat in their humps. 
					 
					 
			 
					 
				
					 
					 					
					 
					 					
					 
						  Grizzly Bear Facts  
						 Did you know that the grizzly bear (Ursus horribilis) can weigh up to 800lbs and reach heights of up to 8 foot when standing on its rear legs. With such mass and size you would expect it to be extremely slow but despite such size it can sprint at speeds as high as 40km/h which is faster than an olympic athlete. 
					 
					 
			 
					 
				
					 
					 					
					 
					 					
					 
						  Some Animals Just Don’t Need Males  
						 Did you know that there are certain animal species where there are no males only females. This is fairly common among insects and worms but also occurs to a lesser extent in some lizards.  Due to only one sex existing the females are actually able to lay eggs without the need of a male (i.e. no fertilization is required). 
					 
					 
			 
					 
				
					 
					 					
					 
					 					
					 
						  Do Jelly Fish Have Bones ?  
						 Did you know that all Jellyfish no matter how large or small have no solid skeleton to support their body. Instead their shape is maintained by soft water filled inner tissues, over which its outer layers are stretched. Take a jelly fish out of water and its beautiful shape and size is visible as nothing more than a primitive lump of jelly.
