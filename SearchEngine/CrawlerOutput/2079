  Life: A Natural 
History of 
the First Four Billion Years 
of Life on Earth (Alfred A. Knopf, 1998) 
by Richard Fortey 
 Abstract:  Richard Fortey presents the prevailing picture 
of how life began, evolved and arrived at its present state. The book 
is punctuated with delightful historical anecdotes and interesting personal 
accounts. It has no prevailing theme, but this is expected: The history 
of life is written in the rocks and cannot be modified. When 
the fossils, however, are "bought to life," an awe-inspiring, fascinating, true story 
springs forth.

 The 
Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New 
Theory of Cosmic Origins (Addison-Wesley, 1997) 
by Alan Guth 
 Abstract: Dr. Alan Guth tells us how he came to 
discover his revolutionary theory of cosmic 
inflation. The hypothesis is that the very fabric of 
space stretched by more than a 
trillion-trillion-trillion-trillion times when the 
Universe was just a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of a 
second old. Because this simple idea explains three 
outstanding problems in cosmology, most scientist 
accept it as part of the Big Bang theory. If 
confirmed, it will radically change the way we view 
the world.

  Life 
of the Cosmos 
(Oxford University Press, 1997) by Lee Smolin 
 Abstract: Dr. Lee Smolin presents his speculative, 
all-encompassing theory of how our Universe with its 
special properties came to be. It is a radical 
proposal that challenges the current thinking of 
cosmologists. He assumes that certain processes allow 
the production of offspring universes and permit the 
laws of Nature to evolve. If true, our Universe may 
be the product of a historical sequence of 
progressive steps similar in character to organic 
evolution. If over millions and millions of years, 
Nature can mold the mammal from a microbe then can 
She also create the stars and planets from a 
microscopic black hole bounce?

  Wonderful Life: The
Burgess Shale and the Nature of History
(W. W. Norton & Company, 1989) by Stephen Jay Gould 
 Abstract: Dr. Stephen Jay Gould dispels some important
misconceptions about evolution. In particular, he examines how
scientists misinterpreted certain ancient Cambrian animal
remains. Gould uses the Cambrian fauna to introduce
his ideas on the importance of random factors
on evolutionary processes. Although it was
published some time ago in 1989, Wonderful Life is still
a great book to learn some natural history. Here is your chance
to relive one of the most important periods in bio-history and
to witness some of the most unusual marine creatures ever to appear on Earth.

 A 
Brief History of Time: From 
the Big Bang to Black Holes (Bantum, 1988) 
by Stephen W. Hawking 
 Abstract: From his wheel chair and with the use of 
a computer, Stephen Hawking has written a book that 
provides us with his insights into cosmology, quantum 
mechanics, particle physics, gravity, black holes, and 
the very nature of space and time. And then he 
continues with a conjectural proposition about the origin of 
the Universe, a speculation that would eliminate 
the need for intervention by a supreme being during 
the moment of creation.
