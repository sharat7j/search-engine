    Science in School advent calendar: subscribe now  

            Mon, 2010-11-29 14:20 — sis
      
   
     
	Dear Science in School subscribers, 
 
	We would like to offer you an advent calendar with a difference - no little doors to open, no pictures of snowmen and no chocolate. Instead, each day for 24 days, we will send you an email with an inspiring teaching idea. Perhaps a science game to play at the end of term, maybe a fun experiment, some fascinating science facts, links to particularly good websites, or a beautiful picture to use in lessons.
