 A welcome message from the County Captain Ros Cuthbert 
 What exciting times we live in especially in Northamptonshire and this is attributed to all the efforts of present and previous County Committee members and the support of the participants of the competitions in this little blue book!!! We may be a small county in comparison to some others but we certainly pack a punch, as demonstrated with the First Team winning the South Midlands Region at County week 2010. Right now we are privileged to have such strength and depth in our county squad, all the teams played some fantastic golf throughout 2010. We could not have done it without your support, so please keep entering the competitions, they are open to you all. 
 The new events introduced last year have proved popular and will remain as part of the blue books pages as long as they are supported and enjoyed.The Mixed Open has changed this year to a four ball better ball and the Am Am was very popular last year so dont delay entering, get that form in quick.Enjoy your golf and remember "a bad round of golf is better than a good day in the office!!!!" 
 Keep hitting that little white sphere and I will see you in the 19th hole!
