					 About the Northeast Ohio Golf Website 	
					 		
 My name is Allen Freeman. I publish this website with the help of a number of other dedicated ‘golf guys’ who run great events throughout Northeast Ohio. 
 This website helps make competitive golf in greater Cleveland and Akron even more fun. The site focuses on local amateur and professional tournament golf better than any other media outlet in the region. (By the way, a lot of golfers think so, too:  see the 2010 site traffic details ) 
 So what’s the value to you? Why should you support this website? 
 Any revenues this website generates means more time can be spent creating great content and building the readership. The more golfers who read the website equals more players who enter area events — and big entry numbers make tournament golf fun. (See, supporting the site really does benefit you!) 
 So how can YOU support NEOHgolf.com? 
 -  ADVERTISE ON THIS WEBSITE  (the best method of all, by far — with options starting as low as just $25!); 
 - click the “DONATE” button in the left column and send a few bucks;  
 - tell other golfers to  sign up for the email newsletter ; 
 -  email golf tournament news  that should be posted here; 
 - purchase the products and services from the Sponsors of this site 
 - click on any of the National Ads of interest that appear on the site. 
 The Northeast Ohio Golf website takes significant time, talent and energy to publish. So please, show a little love — and thank you in advance for your support!
