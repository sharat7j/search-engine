  Is short stature associated with a 'shortage' of genes? (11/28/2011)   New research sifts through the entire genome of thousands of human subjects to look for genetic variation associated with height. The results of the study, published by Cell Press in the December issue of the American Journal of Human Genetics, suggest that uncommon genetic deletions are associated with short stature....>  Full Article     Genetic study confirms: First dogs came from East Asia (11/26/2011)   Researchers at Sweden's KTH Royal Institute of Technology say they have found further proof that the wolf ancestors of today's domesticated dogs can be traced to southern East Asia -- findings that run counter to theories placing the cradle of the canine line in the Middle East....>  Full Article     Predators drive the evolution of poison dart frogs' skin patterns (11/24/2011)          Natural selection has played a role in the development of the many skins patterns of the tiny Ranitomeya imitator poison dart frog. ...>  Full Article        Study of flower petals shows evolution at the cellular level (11/21/2011)   A new study of flower petals shows evolution in action, and contradicts more that 60 years of scientific thought.  Columbine flowers, known as Aquilegia, evolved several lengths of petal spurs that match the tongue lengths of their pollinators, including bees, hummingbirds and hawkmoths....>  Full Article     Soybean adoption came early by many cultures, archaeologists say (11/20/2011)          Human domestication of soybeans is thought to have first occurred in central China some 3,000 years ago, but archaeologists now suggest that cultures in even earlier times and in other locations adopted the legume. ...>  Full Article        Dramatic diversity of columbine flowers explained by a simple change in cell shape (11/18/2011)          Columbine flowers are recognizable by the long, trailing nectar spurs that extend from the bases of their petals, tempting the taste buds of their insect pollinators. According to results published today in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the dramatic diversity in the length of the columbines' spurs is the result of one simple change during development: the extent of cell elongation. ...>  Full Article     
	 
	  
	  
	 
   Ancient DNA provides new insights into cave paintings of horses (11/11/2011)   An international team of researchers has used ancient DNA to shed new light on the realism of horses depicted in prehistoric cave paintings.
The team, which includes researchers from the University of York, has found that all the color variations seen in Paleolithic cave paintings -- including distinctive "leopard" spotting -- existed in pre-domestic horse populations, lending weight to the argument that the artists were reflecting their natural environment.
...>  Full Article     Analysis reveals malaria, other diseases as ancient, adaptive and persistent foes (11/5/2011)   One of the most comprehensive analyses yet done of the ancient history of insect-borne disease concludes for the first time that malaria is not only native to the New World, but it has been  present long before humans existed and has evolved through birds and monkeys....>  Full Article     The benefits of being the first to settle (11/4/2011)          New research into the genealogies of early human pioneers suggests that the settlers who were first to colonize a new region of the world produced more offspring than the settlers who followed them.  ...>  Full Article        Shared genes with Neanderthal relatives not unusual (11/4/2011)   During human evolution our ancestors mated with Neanderthals, but also with other related hominids. In this week's online edition of PNAS, researchers from Uppsala University are publishing findings showing that people in East Asia share genetic material with Denisovans, who got the name from the cave in Siberia where they were first found....>  Full Article     Researchers complete mollusk evolutionary tree (10/30/2011)          Researchers at Brown University and partner institutions have compiled the most comprehensive evolutionary tree for mollusks to date. Their analysis surprisingly places two enigmatic groups, cephalopods and monoplacophorans, as sister clades. The team has also shown that there was a single origin for shelled mollusks. Results appear in Nature. ...>  Full Article        'Junk DNA' defines differences between humans and chimps (10/29/2011)          DNA sequences for human and chimpanzees are nearly identical, despite vast phenotypical differences between the two species. Georgia Tech researchers have determined that the insertion and deletion of large pieces of DNA near genes are highly variable between humans and chimpanzees and may account for these major differences. ...>  Full Article        The cannabis genome: How hemp got high (10/23/2011)   Throughout history, Cannabis sativa has been exploited by humanity. Hemp seed oil is rich in omega 6, and its fiber is used in the production of fabrics.  Marijuana is known for its mind-altering properties. The changes to the genome that led to drug-producing plants is a mystery of cannabis evolution, but one that has now been solved, thanks to an article published today in BioMed Central's open-access journal Genome Biology....>  Full Article     Young human-specific genes correlated with human brain evolution (10/22/2011)   Young genes that appeared since the primate branch split from other mammal species are expressed in unique structures of the developing human brain, a new analysis finds. The correlation suggests that scientists studying the evolution of the human brain should look to genes considered recent by evolutionary standards and early stages of brain development.
...>  Full Article     Genetic study of cave millipedes reveals isolated populations and ancient divergence between species (10/20/2011)          Cave millipedes of the genus Tetracion are found on the southern Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee and Alabama, USA. New genetic analyses show that their populations are generally isolated and genetically distinct. Genetic divergence between two species of Tetracion suggests they diverged several million years ago. The study was published in the open-access journal International Journal of Myriadopology. ...>  Full Article
