     When others fail,  we will be the one transforming your response  to mathematics and statistics  from “I never been able to do it” to “I can have a go”  We are committed to breaking those mental blocks  with games and laughter.  
     Statistic aims to refresh the character of mathematics. Emotions and atmosphere  whilst learning become memories that create  the foundations to  understanding.  Statistica is giving everyone the confidence  to achieve their goals through  an inclusive and enjoyable environment.   No case is too hopeless; no level too low  Statistica knows the only way is up  Privacy Statement 2011       Updated November 2011
