 Welcome to CaddyBytes tournament page for the 2011
PGA Tour School's National Qualifying golf tournament.  The grueling 108 hole final tournament is to be played over the
PGA West Nicklaus Resort and PGA West Stadium golf courses beginning December
2nd through 5th 2011.   
 
 Players finishing
126 thru 150 position on the PGA Tour's 2010 season ending money list and 21
through 50 on the 2011 Nationwide Tour are
automatically eligible and make up the rest of the field for this year's annual
'Fall Classic'.  
 
The final field here in 2011 is 170 qualifiers play each course a total of three times with the top
25 finishers and
ties earning their tour cards for the 2011 PGA Tour Season and the next 70 and
ties earning full playing privileges on the Nationwide (developmental)
Tour.  The same will apply here in 2010 with players who finished out of
the top 125 in 2010 attempting to win or
win back their playing privileges for the 2011 PGA Tour golf season.
