                1979, scientists in Alvin dove to the Mid-Ocean Ridge
                in the eastern Pacific. A spectacular sight greeted them. Clouds
                of what looked like black smoke were billowing from tall chimneys
                on the ocean floor.

 DIVE & DISCOVERª PRESENTS: 
  
   In 1977, scientists made a stunning discovery on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean that forever changed our understanding of planet Earth and life on it. They found seafloor vents gushing shimmering, warm, mineral-rich fluids into the cold, dark depths. And, to their complete surprise, they found that the vents were brimming with extraordinary, unexpected life. 
 
 Dive into hydrothermal vents  and explore their unique geology, chemistry and biology.
