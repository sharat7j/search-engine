     <p>
	Dear <em>Science in School</em> subscribers,</p>
<p>
	We would like to offer you an advent calendar with a difference - no little doors to open, no pictures of snowmen and no chocolate. Instead, each day for 24 days, we will send you an email with an inspiring teaching idea. Perhaps a science game to play at the end of term, maybe a fun experiment, some fascinating science facts, links to particularly good websites, or a beautiful picture to use in lessons.</p><p><a href="http://www.scienceinschool.org/alerts/adventcalendar" target="_blank">read more</a></p>
