									    We are an Irish family-run community pharmacy.    
										  We could include a set of goals and aims on this page that would sound
										like the Gettysburg address. It's very hard to waffle on about how much we care
										and how understanding and helpful we are without coming over all false and
										saccharine.    So just call in or phone us to experience the sort of
										pharmacy you thought had disappeared during the Celtic Tiger years.   
										  John and Lori Barry.
