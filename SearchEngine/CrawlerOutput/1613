              Mission 
            Join DIVE AND DISCOVER on a one-week expedition
              to some of the Earth's most spectacular  hydrothermal  vents.  
                           
            DIVE AND DISCOVER's first voyage takes you to the Gulf of California,
            the sliver of ocean separating Baja California from mainland Mexico.
            It's a place of stunning scenery where mountains rise sharply above
            blue water and white beaches, where the warm waters are rich in marine
            life, and where California gray whales return every winter to give
            birth.
               
               
              Deep beneath the blue waters lie even more stunning
                biological and geological wonders. Here can be found part of
                the global  mid-ocean
                ridge  system
                where the Earth's crust is born. Large fractures called  transform
                faults  cut
                across the seafloor. Between these faults lie deep basins where
                the seafloor is spreading apart. It is within these basins where
                new ocean crust emerges and scalding seawater jets out of hydrothermal
                vents like smoke from a locomotive.

                   Geology of the Guaymas
                  Basin  
               In 1980, researchers from the Scripps Institution
                of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, sent the deep-sea robot
                DeepTow down to map one of these mid-ocean ridge spreading centers-the
                2,000 meter-deep Guaymas Basin. There they discovered spectacular  black
                smoker  vents.
                Surrounding the smokers was a lush community of deep-sea organisms
                ranging from tubeworms and giant clams to the tiny microorganisms
                that feed off of chemicals spouting out of the vents. 
               
                 Deeper Discovery... 
                     
             
               Now a team of scientists led by Dr. Craig Cary
                and Dr. George Luther of the University of Delaware and Dr. Anna-Louise
                Reysenbach of Portland State University has returned to Guaymas
                Basin. The scientists will dive to hydrothermal vents on the
                seafloor on board Alvin, the Woods Hole Oceanographic InstitutionÕs
                deep-diving research submarine. There they will map the vents
                and surrounding seafloor, collect minerals from the chimneys,
                and analyze the chemicals spouting up from the vents. Finally
                they will collect and study the fascinating organisms that depend
                on these chemicals to survive. 
               This research will not only provide valuable information
                about deep-sea vent biology and chemistry, it may provide tantalizing
                clues about the origin of life on Earth. 
               Join Drs. Cary, Luther and Reysenbach and their
                team of scientists, students and engineers on each exciting dive
                into the Guaymas Basin. 
               Objectives 
                  The biological communities that have evolved
                  around hydrothermal vents thrive in conditions that are almost
                  unimaginable. The organisms live in total darkness. They feed
                  off of chemicals that are toxic to most other living things,
                  including people. Some of these organisms survive in water
                  hotter than 100¡C (212¡F). 
               Yet scientists now hypothesize that the first life
                on Earth may have evolved under these hot and corrosive conditions.
                Genetic analysis has shown that many of the microbes that live
                around vents today are closely related to these first microbes. 
               Scientists diving to to vents in Guaymas Basin
                will begin to test the theory that life may have originated around
                hydrothermal vents or under similar conditions. They will search
                for clues in the chemicals coming out of the vents and among
                the microbes that live around the vents. 
               Pyrite the Key? 
              The Guaymas Basin team is focusing their attention on one mineral
                in particular. This mineral is called pyrite, or fools gold.
                Black smoker chimneys are made of pyrite. 
               Pyrite is formed when hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and
                iron monosulfide (FeS) react. Both of these chemicals are present
                in the hydrothermal fluid that jets out of the vents. 
               Here is the chemical reaction: 
                hydrogen sulfide (H2S) + iron monosulfide (FeS) -- -----> pyrite
                (FeS2) + hydrogen gas (H2) + energy 
               Some scientists now propose that this chemical
                reaction may have played a key role in the origin of life. 
               Providing Energy for Life 
              All organisms need energy to survive. We get energy from the food
                we eat. Plants get energy from the sun. The microbes that inhabit
                hydrothermal vents get their energy from chemicals in the hydrothermal
                fluids. The process by which organisms harvest energy from chemicals
                is called chemosynthesis. 
               Some scientists propose that the first microbes
                may have gotten their energy from the chemical reaction between
                H2S and FeS that forms pyrite. Another possibility is that the
                microbes got their energy from hydrogen gas that is produced
                during the pyrite reaction. Today, there are many microbes living
                in high-temperature waters that use hydrogen as an energy source. 
               Testing the Hypothesis 
              The scientists on this cruise will begin to test the hypothesis
                that life originated around hydrothermal vents or under similar
                conditions. One of the first tests is to try and find microbes
                living today that use the pyrite reaction to get energy. 
               
                 They will use an extremely sensitive chemical
                  sensor called a voltametric microelectrode attached to Alvin
                  to detect hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and iron monosulfide (FeS).
                  Remember that these are the chemicals that react to form pyrite. 
                 Using Alvin, they will collect vent
                  chimney samples and microbes from areas where they find high
                  concentrations of H2S and FeS and bring them back up to the
                  ship for analysis. They will identify and catalog all of the
                  microbes they find. 
                 Finally they will try to culture (grow) the
                  microbes in an environment where H2S and FeS are reacting to
                  form pyrite. Using this experimental approach, the scientists
                  will test whether these microbes can survive by using the energy
                  from the pyrite reaction.
