 Welcome to CaddyBytes Slide Show of holes 9 thru 18 of the PGA West Stadium golf course -one of the West Coast's host site golf courses for the PGA Tour's National Qualifying golf tournament.  Our slide show begins with the tee shot on the par 4 10th hole on thru the 18th green of the back nine holes. The PGA West Stadium course was exclusively designed by Pete Dye in 1986.  It's tournament target golf where accuracy is rewarded while errant shots are severely penalized. There are tiered landing areas, with forced carries over water off many tees guarding firm elevated greens, where jagged and deep greenside bunkers abound.
