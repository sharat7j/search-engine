   Product Review: Taylormade Burner Superfast 2.0 Fairway Woods 
 Taylormade Golf Company has come out with a new brand of golf clubs that really have a striking appearance to them.  The Taylormade Burner Superfast 2.0 fairway woods are a part of this new trend, in which the clubhead is white while the clubface itself is black.  It is truly a unique blend of colors that match well together.  As far as other specifications, the fairway woods are comprised of very lightweight clubheads that are designed to increase swing speed, along with the Winn Lite grip and Matrix XCon shaft that come stock with the club. The Superfast fairway woods are also designed for greater carry, with the clubface having a low center of gravity.  With that said here is my overall review of the Taylormade Burner Superfast 2.0 fairway woods. 
 Positive 
 The first positive that I noticed came on the first tee box, where the ball just jumped off of the clubface.  I don’t know what it is about all the new technology these days, but I like it more and more as my distance goes down with age.  It was not just the tee shots either, but practically every shot that was hit felt solid.  I even tried putting a golf ball in an old divot and the ball still shot out straight and true.  This goes into my next positive, in that the Taylormade Burner Superfast 2.0 fairway woods are extremely forgiving.  It did not matter if I hit it off of the toe or the heel, the golf clubs still performed well above expectations. 
 The third positive that I found with these fairway woods is that it is easy to work the ball either way, more so off the tee than in the fairway.  If there was a hole that required a draw for instance, I could simply use my draw swing and the club would do the rest for me.  It is truly effortless swinging these golf clubs, and a lot of that is due in part to the lightweight features I mentioned earlier.  Lastly, the fairway woods are extremely durable and could probably last for years and years.  After a few long sessions on the driving range I thought the clubs might have lost their distance but they certainly proved me wrong out on the golf course time and time again. 
 Negative 
 It was truly difficult trying to find any sort of negatives with the Taylormade Burner Superfast 2.0 fairway woods, but if I had to be nitpicky I would have to go with its performance out of the rough.  When it came to fairway bunkers the clubs would work perfectly and get the ball straight up in the air upon impact, but it just didn’t feel the same when hitting them out of the rough (and especially deep rough).  I just could not get solid contact between the club and ball at all in the rough, and maybe this is due in part to the clubs being so lightweight.  Regardless, this was the only real negative that I could find when it came to these fairway woods. 
 Conclusion 
 The Taylormade Burner Superfast 2.0 fairway woods are a great step in the right direction for Taylormade Golf Company.  If you have been with them for their drivers, you should definitely try out their fairway woods, as they are as good as, if not better than, many other competitiors out on the market today.  These fairway woods are that good.

   Golf Product Review: Bridgestone Tour B330 RXS Golf Ball Review 
 Bridgestone has been quietly jumping up the ladder as far as the golf ball market is concerned.  One of the areas in which they have strived to match their competition in is tour-level golf balls, known as the Tour B330 line.  The first two balls that Bridgestone came out with, the Tour B330 and B330S, were a huge success and are currently used by PGA Tour players such as Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, and Davis Love III.  Since then Bridgestone has come out with a new type of golf ball, one that provides tour level performance for amateur players, known as the RX line.  The RX line includes the B330 RX, which is more geared for players looking for distance, and the B330 RXS, which is geared for players looking for more short iron spin.  I decided to give the Bridgestone B330 RXS golf ball a try to see if it can really provide tour performance for amateur golfers (those with swing speeds less than 105 miles per hour). 
 Positives 
 Even through the B330 RX is supposed to offer more distance as opposed to the RXS, I found the RXS to have great distance both off the tee and in the fairway.  The distance was certainly comparable to that of a Pro V1 or a Callaway Tour golf ball.  On average I was getting about 3 to five yards extra distance on both my iron and wood shots, which is certainly surprising to find in a golf ball.  If anything it proves that in order to increase distance one of the first things to try out is better golf equipment such as new clubs or balls such as the B330 RXS. 
 When it came to the short game, I was also pleasantly surprised to find out how well it performed.  There wasn’t very much backspin on say 75 yard pitch shots, but how many amateur golfers are really looking for that to happen when hitting a pitch shot from that distance?  In either case, the ball did stop quickly whenever I wanted it to, not only on pitch shots but also when it came to chipping.  Whenever I needed to hit a bump and run chip the ball would always check up.  The Bridgestone B330 RXS golf ball also feels great when putting.  There is a very useful putting alignment on it that makes it easier to line up putts where you want them to go. 
 Negatives 
 As far as negatives, the only major one that I found came in regards to shots into the green using mid to high irons.  The golf ball just would not stay on the green no matter what I tried; it would hit the green and then just keep rolling.  How can a supposed tour-level performance golf ball not provide decent spin for mid and long iron shots?  Also, I found it a bit harder to shape shots with as opposed to similar balls such as the Pro V1.  The ball is fine if trying to hit low or high shots, but it seemed to exaggerate fades and draws, making them instead slices and hooks. 
 Overall 
   
 Overall it is a very solid golf ball for amateurs looking for a high performance golf ball.  It provides distance comparable to any other golf ball on the market today and could even add a few extra yards to your iron and wood shots.  It is also great for the short game as well, but one should be a little cautious when it comes to mid to long irons shots when hitting into the green.

   Cleveland Launcher Fairway Woods 
 
After hearing rave reviews from my golf buddies about the Cleveland Launcher fairway woods, I decided to give them a try out on the golf course for a few rounds to see how they fared.  What supposedly makes these woods exceptional is the steel face, which is both thin and lightweight.  They have pear shaped clubheads, which is traditional in nature and shouldn’t throw anyone off.  The first thing that I noticed about the fairways woods was their appearance, in that the golf shaft compliments the steel head very well; it is certainly not something that one usually sees when it comes to fairway woods. 
 Positives 
 When playing out at my local golf course a few times the first positive that I noticed right away with the clubs was their distance.  They were very long both off the tee and in the fairway.  They certainly inspire confidence when playing with them during the course of a round.  This can be especially important when it comes to golf holes that have tight fairways to deal with.  Instead of taking out the driver and risking it going into the trees, one can be assured that they will still get great distance off the tee by going with a Cleveland Launcher fairway wood.  The same applies to par 5s as well.  I am usually very hesitant in trying to go for par 5s in two when I can reach them because if I am only a little bit off it can result in a pitch from an awkward distance, thus reducing my chance at getting birdie.  With these fairway woods I just grip it and rip it, and the club does the rest by giving me the distance I need. 
 Another great feature that I found when using Cleveland Launcher fairway woods was how easy it was to shape shots with.  There are a couple of holes at my local golf course that require a hook because it is a dogleg left hole, and I like many others struggle to get the ball to go left.  With this club it was much easier to turn the clubhead over and get the right to left action on the golf ball.  The ball flight with these fairway woods was tremendous to say the least. 
 Negatives 
 There were two negatives that I found when using the Cleveland Launcher fairway woods.  The first came in regards to its forgiveness.  Whenever I hit off center shots with the woods they were severely off in both distance and accuracy.  It may be a different case for others, but I just could not get much forgiveness out of these golf clubs.  Also, these fairway woods did not perform very well for me out of bad lies, especially from the rough.  The clubs just never seemed to glide through the grass like others could, and it resulted in a lot of distance lost.  I also found that I couldn’t get very good distance out of fairway bunker shots when compared with other fairway woods in a similar price range. 
 Overall 
 My overall opinion of the Cleveland Launcher fairway woods is that they are some great clubs for those looking to add distance to this specific part of their game.  The clubs can certainly inspire confidence both on the tee box and in the fairway.  However, they certainly are not the best when it comes to forgiveness and out of bad lies.  If you are willing to overlook these two flaws then I would highly recommend getting these fairway woods.

   Callaway Tour iS Golf Ball Review 
 Over the past few years Callaway has been making great strides in the golf ball market.  It now offers golf balls for practically any handicap imaginable, and has great quality golf balls that are played by the likes of Phil Mickelson and Ernie Els on the PGA Tour as well.  One of the more recent high-end golf balls that has come out is the Callaway Tour iS golf ball.  It has received a lot of hype since it has come out, being featured on Golf Digest’s Hot List for 2011 for instance. 
 The Callaway Tour iS is technologically advanced as a four piece golf ball (I guess three isn’t good enough these days or something) and its main purpose is to help golfers with their short games.  Along with most of their other golf balls the Callaway Tour iS has HEX Aerodynamics; this means that when you look at the golf ball the dimples are hexagons instead of regular circles.  This supposedly makes the ball better able to get good ball flight in practically any weather condition imaginable.  Another feature concerning the Callaway Tour iS is its dual core technology, which is pretty self explanatory in which the golf ball has two cores (hence being a four piece golf ball instead of three piece), and it supposedly help in getting maximum distance along with great short game feel.  With all of that said, does all of this technology in a golf ball really help your game?  I decided to give the Callaway Tour iS a try over a few rounds to see if it can really live up to its hype.  What follows is my review of the golf ball. 
 Short Game 
 
As far as the short game, the ball lives up to its hype; it is truly a great short game ball that can rival any other brand on the market today.  Especially from 100 yards and in the golf ball checks up beautifully and provides a good amount of backspin when needed.  When it came to chipping bump and runs were very easy to execute and the Callaway Tour iS checks up every time.  It was even great out of bunkers too.  As anyone knows it can be quite difficult getting a golf ball to stop on the green when hitting a greenside bunker shot, but I was able to consistently get the ball to stop on the green; the same applied to fairway bunker shots as well.  When it came to putting the golf ball felt great and rolled true every time.  It certainly provides added confidence when putting on the green. 
 Long Game 
 The Callaway Tour iS is a really great ball to shape shots with, whether it is a fade, a hook, or even a riser (where the ball starts low and increases height).  I just used the appropriate swing for each shot and the golf ball did the rest for me.  I got some pretty good distance out of the fairway woods and driver, and I would it was comparable to similar golf balls.  The major downside for the Callaway Tour iS came in regards to long iron shots (5 iron to 3 iron).  The distance that I got for this kind of shot was well below average (about 5 yards shorter than a Pro V1).  I play from the back tees and 5 yards means a lot, so I pleasantly surprised to find this out. 
 Conclusion 
 The Callaway Tour iS certainly lives up to its hype as a great short game ball.  I would say that it is a great fit for someone who already gets good distance and is looking to improve their short game stats.  The only downside that I found when using the ball was long iron shots, but other than the Callaway Tour iS performed very well.

		  Maxfli Revolution Stand Bag Review

   Maxfli Revolution Stand Bag 
 For those of us who like to walk when playing golf, there are a few characteristics in a golf bag that are a must.  The first is that it must be lightweight.  The golf bag must also have sturdy pockets to store items in as well as a comfortable straps and a durable stand.  With that said I came across the Maxfli Revolution Stand Bag and decided to try it out for awhile since there was a sale on it.  Does it stand up to what a walking golfer really needs? 
 General Information 
 The Maxfli Revolution Stand Bag is made mostly of nylon and polyester to make it supposedly last for years.  It features around 10 club dividers along with multiple pockets throughout.  They are various sizes and include ones for a scorecard, valuables, garments, golf balls, you name it.  As far as the straps there is one for each shoulder, constructed with an “o” ring to add comfort. 
 Positives 
 When it comes to a walking (or stand) bag having a good amount of pockets is a must, and this golf bag certainly provides everything that is needed.  Another great positive going for the Maxfli Revolution Stand Bag is its weight; it is one of lightest bags that I have used in this price range (around $100).  It is very easy to walk eighteen holes using this golf bag.  I also found it to be a great bag to use when playing golf with a cart, as the club dividers make it easy to take the clubs out and put them back in, along with the strategically places pockets providing added convenience.  The straps on the golf bag are very plush and provide a great amount of comfort when carrying the clubs from hole to hole.    The stand comes right out every single time and is not like other stand bags that always seem to get caught up in something from time to time. 
   
 Negatives 
   
 The main negative for the Maxfli Revolution Stand Bag is its overall durability.  Having only played with it for a couple of months there seem to be durability issues when it comes to the zippers for the pockets as well as the straps themselves.  In regards to the zippers, they seem to get stuck very easily if you pull them up or down quickly.  It can be a hassle trying to get a zipper unstuck when out on the golf course, especially if there are impatient golfers playing right up on you.  In fact, one of them even broke off when trying to get it unstuck.  The quality of the zippers overall is suspect, along with mentioning the shoulder straps.  For some strange reason every stand bag I get that has an “o” ring construction does not last for very long until some problems start arising, whether it is the straps getting caught up or the ring looking like it is going to break at any moment.  Finally, while there are many different pockets, they are of various sizes and it can difficult trying to figure out what each one is exactly for. 
 Overall Consensus 
 My overall consensus of the Maxfli Revolution Stand Bag is that it is an average stand bag for its price.  There is nothing that really separates itself from any other stand bag, and there are in fact some negative aspects to it that should be taken into consideration before purchasing it.  If you are one of those who plays a lot this may not be the bag for you, but if you play off and on and like to use a cart every once in a while it may work out if you can find the golf bag for a good value.

		  Adams A70S Hybrid Review – New and Used

   Adams A70S Hybrid 
 Long irons are quickly becoming a relic of the past with the introduction of hybrid clubs in the game of golf.  Instead of having to hit difficult shots with a high iron, one can instead get the ball in the air much easier using a hybrid.  There is only one company on the cutting edge when it comes to hybrid clubs, and that is Adams Golf.  Their Idea series hybrids have won numerous awards over the past few years and are played by both PGA and Champions Tour players alike.  With such a great reputation of building quality golf products, I decided to give the Adams A70S Hybrid a try. 
 General Information 
 As a Golf Digest Top Pick for 2010 in both innovation and value, the Adams A70S hybrid is in a league of its own when it comes to these types of golf clubs.  The hybrid club has three features worth mentioning.  The first two involve the weight placement.  There is a total of 44 grams placed on both the heel and toe of the golf club to increase distance and add forgiveness.  The weighting is also placed lower than their previous hybrid models, which provides a higher launch angle and increased spin.  The last feature worth mentioning is the shaft, which is a Grafalloy Prolaunch Axis, which gives added distance along with great feel when swinging the golf club. 
 Positives 
 The first positive that I noticed when swinging the Adams A70S Hybrid for the first time was its clean look.  There is nothing fancy or complicated lines on it or anything like that; it is very easy on the eyes and can surely give added confidence before anyone swings the golf club.  The best positive associated with its golf club is its forgiveness.  I intentionally hit a few shots off of both the heel and the toe of the golf club, and all of the shots went much further (and more accurate) than expected.  What is great about this golf club as well is that it is great to hit both on the tee and in the fairway.  There are a few doglegs at a local course I play at and I was able to tee it up and hit the exact kind of shots I needed to hit with confidence.  If you know how to hit a draw or a fade with a normal club, you will be surprised at how much easier it is to do it with this golf club.  When it came to distance, the golf club was comparable to that of others on the market. 
   
 Negatives 
 The main negative for the Adams A70S Hybrid came in regards to bad lies.  Sure, it is great to hit out of the fairway and off the tee, but none of us can keep it in the fairway all the time.  It is important to have a golf club that can inspire confidence when hitting out of bad lies such as deep rough, and I just could not find it when using this golf club.  Maybe it has to do with the way the weighting is set up or something, but it was very difficult to hit solid shots out of deep rough when using this hybrid.  Usually a hybrid just cuts through the grass like butter (Callaway Heavenwood comes to mind) but with this club both the distance and the accuracy was off.  I was also a little surprised when it came to fairway bunker shots as well.  Hybrids are a great alternative to hitting a high iron shot out of there, but I found myself hitting better shots using a choked down five wood as opposed to this club.  Again, I do not know if it has to do with the weight distribution or something, but the shots just did not feel solid. 
 Overall Consensus 
 My overall consensus on the Adams A70S Hybrid is that it certainly lives up to its billing as a well made golf club.  While it may not be the best club to use in bad lies, it is absolutely fantastic to hit from the fairway and off the tee.  It is also very easy to shape shots and get good distance when using this hybrid, and is recommended for mid to low handicap players.
