 Welcome to Caddybytes Slide Show of holes 9 thru 18 of the PGA West Jack Nicklaus Tournament golf course -one of the two host golf courses to the West Coast's version of the PGA Tour National Qualifying golf tournament.  Our slide show begins with a picture of the par 4 -9th hole on thru the 18th green of the back nine holes of the Nicklaus Tournament golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus -one of the premier PGA West courses.  Carved out of the natural desert terrain the tee shot landing areas are wide into tiered greens surrounded by deep greenside sand and grass bunkers to confound the golfer who 'wrong side misses'.
