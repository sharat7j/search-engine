                              "The course was well put together 
                              and easy to understand. I am very pleased with your 
                              setup and the examples you have used. I was able 
                              to relate to them very easily. Also, the ability 
                              to check your answers and learning how to formulate 
                              problems was a great tool. I have done multiple 
                              online courses and have to state that this is as 
                              simple as it can get and the Customer Service is 
                              phenomenal. I will be referring friends and contacts 
                              to this course. Excellent Job!"

                              Canada - "Very practical, lots of 
                              examples, easy to understand. Rather than just a 
                              review of math, the course was very applied with 
                              a number of very practical real-world examples. 
                              It showed me that I already knew enough to be making 
                              improvements in processes, but just didn't know 
                              how to apply it. The email support was very thorough 
                              and contained personal responses, not "canned" 
                              answers; individual attention was at least as good 
                              as in a classroom setting, if not better."

                              Analysis Engineer, Raytheon - "I learned 
                              several important concepts in statistics and how 
                              to apply them correctly. They include how to design 
                              and apply statistical tests to evaluate products 
                              and processes, analyze the relationships between 
                              process inputs and outputs using regression analysis, 
                              how to use ANOVA to analyze the results of simple 
                              experiments, apply probability theory to various 
                              situations using discrete distribution methods and 
                              formulas. Responses to emails were outstanding."
