	 My Favorite Quote : 
"Never tell people how to do things.

Tell them what to do and they

will surprise you with their ingenuity." 

-- George S. Patton(1885-1945), American military leader 
	  

 
 

 
 
 
 
   
 
Mankind's Greatest Achievement   

 

"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal,
before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him
safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more
impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of
space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish." 
-President Kennedy, May 25, 1961
