 * US win 24th World Cup 
 * Ireland falter, finish fourth

 (Adds details, quotes) 
 By Bernie McGuire 
 HAIKOU, China, Nov 27 (Reuters) -  Matt Kuchar  and  Gary
Woodland  gave the United States a 24th World Cup on Sunday after
the duo reeled in overnight leaders Ireland and held off the
charge of fast-finishing England. 

                 
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                   
  
 

                 
                 The victory at the Blackstone course comes a week after
Kuchar helped the United States win another team event, the
Presidents Cup, in Australia. 
 The U.S. team fired a final round of 67 to take the title
with a combined 24-under-par 264, two shots ahead of England and
Germany in joint second place. 
 Ireland’s  Rory McIlroy  and  Graeme McDowell  started Sunday
with a two-shot lead but endured a frustrating day and carded an
even par 72 for a share of fourth. 
 Kuchar told reporters he was proud to have won the title for
America. 
 “You think of all the sporting events, and you think of all
the teams that become world champions, and in golf there are not
that many opportunities to be world champions,” he said. 
 “So to represent the United States of America and become
world champions just feels great.” 
 The American duo began the final round two strokes behind
McIlroy and McDowell but moved to the top of the 28-nation
leaderboard after birdies on the opening two holes and at the
sixth and seventh. A bogey on 11 was the only blip but they
rebounded with birdies on the 12th and 13th. 
 Kuchar and Woodland cruised home to slip on the traditional
golden jackets and take first prize cheques of $1.2 million. 
 “On Saturday we really clicked together and played a great
round and when Matt got up-and-down at the last that gave us the
momentum into today’s final round,” Woodland told reporters. 
 “So we came out today to birdie the first two holes and that
really got us going.” 
 FROM SUBDUED TO CRAZY 
 England’s  Ian Poulter  and  Justin Rose  produced the round of
the day, a nine-under 63, to climb to second place on 22-under
par with Germany’s  Martin Kaymer  and  Alex Cejka  (69). 
 Poulter and Rose were eight strokes off the lead going into
the final round but started their charge with four birdies in
their opening six holes before playing the closing four holes in
four under. 
 “We … were a little subdued last night and neither of us
were much company,” said Poulter. “We stayed in our own rooms,
and kind of rightly so as four-under par in fourball was very
disappointing. 
 “But to go and shoot nine-under par in foursomes is crazy. 
 “When we look back at rounds of golf, that’s why we play
golf, and to have that much fun with a few holes to play, like
to birdie 15 and to eagle 16, was great.” 
 However, it was disappointment for Ireland for the second
World Cup in a row after McIlroy and McDowell faltered when it
mattered most. The pair had also been leading the event in 2009
but were overhauled by Italy on the final day. 
 They had four birdies and bogeys for a level par 72, sharing
fourth with Australians  Richard Green  and  Brendan Jones  (69),
the Scottish duo of  Martin Laird  and  Stephen Gallacher  (66), and
 Joost Luiten  and Robert Jan Derksen (68) of Netherlands. 
 The Guatemala team of Jose Toledo and  Pablo Acuna  were
celebrating their 27th place after a final round 70. They
finished 11 shots better than Belgium. 
 “We’ve had a fantastic week and have easily exceeded our
expectations,” Toledo told Reuters. “It’s been a good experience
for Pablo and myself.”
