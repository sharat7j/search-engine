		 Nata?a Gros, Tim Harrison, Irena ?trumbelj Drusany and Alma Kapun Dolinar introduce a selection of experiments with a simple spectrometer designed especially for schools – and give details of how to perform one of the activities.  
       
	   
	   To motivate school students through a hands-on approach to chemistry, we and our project partners developed a collection of experiments using small-scale, low-cost spectrometers. In the project, we used a simple school spectrometer developed by one of the partners (Nata?a Gros). The spectrometer can be easily upgraded to form other analytical instruments, for example gas and liquid chromatographs, allowing a further range of school experiments (see the project website  w1  ). Limited numbers of the instruments are available for loan to schools. 
	   How spectrometers work 
	   In a spectrometer, the white light from a light source (a bulb) enters a monochromator, from which only light of the chosen wavelength (colour) emerges; this then passes through a solution in the optical cell, or cuvette (see  Figure 1 ). The solution absorbs a fraction of the light and a detector measures the resulting reduction in the light intensity (the absorbance). The deeper the colour of the solution, the higher the absorbance measurement.

	   The most widely used cuvettes have an optical path length of 1 cm and require at least 3 ml of solution for a successful measurement. The main objective of a general-purpose spectrometer is accuracy and precision of absorbance measurement: the wavelength selection should be as accurate as possible and the light highly monochromatic (i.e., with a narrow range of wavelength). As a consequence, the construction of the instrument is complicated and not very obvious to a typical user – and the instrument itself is expensive. 
 
		 
		 
		   Instead, the main objective when developing the Spektra TM  spectrometer was to produce a low-cost, portable and robust instrument with a simple and intuitive design and operation, allowing for low reagent consumption and a simplified experimental approach ( Gros, 2004 ). This spectrometer is primarily intended for educational purposes, especially for the introduction of concepts, but it has also proved useful for on-the-spot quantitative or semi-quantitative determinations of samples. 
		   Spektra comprises two optical elements: a tri-colour light emitting diode (LED) and a light sensor. Blue (430 nm), green (565 nm) or red (625 nm) light can be selected; this passes directly through the liquid layer and strikes the sensor (see Figure 2). The most essential components (the light source, the measuring chamber and the sensor) are all visible: for students, the instrument is not a ‘black box’, but is easy to understand and operate (see  Figures 3a and b ).

		 Reactions and measurements take place in polymeric supports called blisters (similar to the plastic packaging on tablets), which allow for small volumes (0.35 ml) of tested solutions, rapid homogenisation of reagents, and small volumes of chemical waste. Experimental work with Spektra is simple and safe, requiring no special laboratory training or laboratory glassware. The volumes of solutions needed are very small: even a drop-based experimental approach can be used where appropriate. 
 The spectrometer can be purchased online  w2  . Alternatively, the University of Bristol  w3  , UK, offers a limited number of Spektra spectrometers for loan by teachers who wish to either try the experiments with their students or develop other practical investigations. For teachers who prefer a conventional instrument, Mystrica colorimeters (using normal, full-scale cuvettes) are also affordable and good quality  w4  . 
 Hands-on experiments in spectrometry 
 As part of the project, a range of practical spectrometry activities was developed to raise interest in science, and to inspire potential future scientists amongst school students. These activities covered topics as varied as water analysis, the physics of light and colour, investigations into Lambert-Beer’s law, chemical equilibrium, environmental analysis, kinetics of chemical reactions and the analysis of food. 
 The food analysis experiments cover the spectrometric determination of iron levels in samples of dried herbs or flour; alcohol content of spirits; glucose levels in jam; colour of beer; colour (quality) of paprika; phosphate levels in apple juice; phosphates and nitrites in meat products; and casein concentration in cheese. Another protocol allows the process of alcohol fermentation to be monitored. 
 The step-by-step instructions for determining the glucose level in jam are presented here; full details of all other experiments – including some suitable for outreach events in primary schools – are available on the project website  w1  . The website also has instructions for upgrading the Spektra instrument to a gas or liquid chromatograph, together with details of experiments that can be carried out with the upgraded equipment (see also  Gros & Vrta?nik, 2005 ). 
 
 Spectrometric determination of the glucose level in jam 
 A number of reactions between sugars and other chemical reagents produce coloured products; the intensity of colour is related to the initial concentration of sugar. The absorbance of sample solutions can be measured and compared to the absorbance of standard solutions of known sugar concentrations. Only a limited number of colour-change reactions are known for polysaccharides, and most involve simple sugars, usually reducing sugars (see  box ). 
 Glucose determination was chosen primarily because students know what sugars are – the activity has widespread appeal. Furthermore, determining the sugar content of jams may have industrial applications in aspects such as quality control. 
 One method to determine the sugar concentration of jam involves hydrolysing many of the non-reducing sugars (in jam, principally sucrose) to glucose, using sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ), after which the sample is neutralised with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). When heated with 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA; also known as 2-hydroxy-3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid), reducing sugars (e.g. glucose and fructose) produce a red-brown product. For more details of this reaction, see  Miller (1959) . 
 The concentration of the coloured complex can be determined with the spectrometer using the blue LED (430 nm): the initial sugar concentration of the jam samples can then be read off a calibration curve created using known glucose concentrations.

Table 2: Preparing the solutions for the calibration curve 
 
   Heat the test tubes and their contents in boiling water for 5 min; the DNSA reagent will react with any sugar present, producing a red-brown product.  
   Cool the test tubes, add 6 ml distilled water to each and shake well.  
   Using the blue LED (430 nm) of the spectrometer, measure the transmittance of each solution. 
  
 The readings from the Spektra instrument are transmittances expressed in percentages and should be divided by 100 to obtain the transmittance values used in the subsequent calculations. Transmittance is related to absorbance as described by the equation: A = –log T. See the second and third columns in  Table 3 . 
 
   
		 
		 The image to the right shows the calibration solutions; even the blank (water and DNSA with no glucose) is an intense colour. It is therefore necessary to measure all the samples, including the blank, against distilled water. The glucose-specific absorbance of the samples is then calculated by subtracting the absorbance measurement of the blank from the absorbance measurement of the sample (see the fourth column of  Table 3 ).

         Measuring the jam samples 
 The jam samples should be treated similarly to the glucose solutions used for the calibration curve. 
 
   For each jam to be tested, put 1 ml prepared jam sample (see ‘Preparation of solutions’) in a test tube and add 1 ml DNSA reagent and 2 ml distilled water.  
   Heat the test tubes and their contents in boiling water for 5 min; the DNSA reagent will react with any sugar present, producing a red-brown product.  
   Cool the test tubes, add 6 ml distilled water to each and shake well.  
   Using the blue LED (430 nm) of the spectrometer, measure the transmittance value (T%) of each jam sample. Divide by 100 to obtain T, convert T to A using the equation A = –log T, and use that to calculate the glucose-specific absorbance (A – A blank ). 
 
 Table 4 shows an example of the transmittance values obtained and the calculated glucose-specific absorbance of each sample.

Table 4: Sample results for jam samples 
 
   Using your calibration curve, convert the absorbance measurements (A) into the concentrations of glucose (mg/ml) in your samples.  
   
 Using the examples from Table 4, the glucose concentrations read off the calibration curve give: 
 
 Sample 1: 0.8 mg/ml 
 Sample 2: 0.5 mg/ml 
 
 
 From the glucose concentrations, calculate the mass of glucose in a 1 g jam sample using the following equation:   
 
 Mass glucose (g per 1g sample) = mass concentration (mg/ml) x 10 x 100 ml 
 
 where 
 
 mass concentration is the value read off the calibration curve 
 10 is the dilution (see ‘Preparation of solutions’) 
 100 ml is the volume of 1g of jam sample. 
 
 In our example, 
 
 Sample 1: mass glucose (g per 1g sample) = 0.8 mg/ml x 10 x 100 ml = 0.8 g 
 Sample 2: mass glucose (g per 1g sample) = 0.5 mg/ml x 10 x 100 ml = 0.5 g. 
 
 The calculations above assume that the initial jam sample was 1 g. If, for example, the sample had weighed 2 g, the figures above would need to be divided by 2 to get the mass of glucose in g per 1 g sample. 
 
         
             Reducing and non-reducing sugars 
		 In chemical terms, a reducing sugar is an aldose such as glucose, which has an aldehyde group that can be oxidised to a carboxylic acid. The more common chemical test to detect reducing sugars is to warm them with either Benedict’s or Fehling’s solutions, which contain copper(II) ions that are reduced to copper(I) oxide and can be observed as a brown-orange precipitate. 
		 Non-reducing sugars, such as sucrose, may have a ketone rather than an aldehyde functional group, which cannot reduce copper(II) ions. When treated with Benedict’s or Fehling’s solutions, non-reducing sugars produce no coloured precipitate.

	   Review 
	   Analytical chemistry relies extensively on spectrometric analysis, but professional instruments are expensive and thus not easily available for average schools in many countries. This article presents a spectrometer developed by one of the authors to make spectrometric analysis affordable to every secondary school. The project website details several school experiments in spectrometry, and the laboratory protocol for one experiment is included in the article. 
	   I would recommend this article for introducing analytical chemistry in science lessons (not only chemistry, but also biology and environmental science), particularly for secondary schools that do not have a well-equipped laboratory. The proposed approach is simple and friendly enough to encourage teachers and students to try the suggested experiments and to explore new ones. 
	   Teachers could use the article for a discussion of the methodology of spectrometry and the theory of spectrometric measurements. The experimental analysis provides the opportunity to analyse the obtained data mathematically, thus linking chemistry and statistics. 
	   The article could also be used for a comprehension exercise. For example:
