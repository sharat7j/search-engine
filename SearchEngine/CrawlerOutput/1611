 Expedition 14 starts today! 
 From November 28 to December 9, 2011, join Dive and Discover as scientists explore super-salty, dense pools of water more than two miles deep in the Mediterranean Sea called brine lakes. What life forms live in this toxic, hyper-saline, lightless environment that lacks oxygen? From the research vessel Atlantis, researchers will use the remotely operated vehicle Jason and a new deep-sea robotic micro-laboratory to study the chemistry of the brine lakes and the organisms they find there. 
  Today's update: Research mission starts with

 What are DHABs? 
 Deep Hypersaline Anoxic Basins, or DHABs,  are some of the most extreme environments on Earth—and yet, life thrives there. DHABs are also very new to science.

 Expedition 14 Activities 
 We've added two new activities to start you thinking about the science behind density and evaporites. 
  Demo for Density  » 
  Make Your Own Evaporite  » 
 
 
    
 Expedition 14 Videos 
 The principal investigators of  Expedition 14 discuss the science of DHABs and their hopes and fears for  this mission.
