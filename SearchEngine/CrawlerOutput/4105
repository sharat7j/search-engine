				   Recent additions worth noting  
				  
				   
				     
				       Please note that in 2011 we have added the following subsections to the page on media: 
		                Free Online Textbooks ,  Simulations ,  Interactive Media Development  
				       2011 
				        Acid-base tutorial  (PDF format; Dan Dill, Boston U) - this excellent tutorial covers all the major topics commonly encountered at the general chemistry level, with an unusually thorough treatment of buffer systems. 
				        Instrumental Chemistry  - This anonymous and rather peculiar set of pages deals mainly with analytical separation methods: theory, liquid phase, gas phase, and sample preparation. It employs a series of selectable graphics, many of them very good, and displays some text relating to each one, although it rarely offers a detailed explanation of each image. 
				        The Khan Academy  is a remarkable and ambitious non-commercial undertaking that offers over 1600 free  Science-related videos  (via YouTube), including a sizeable number devoted to  Chemistry . The videos I have looked at are basically animated blackboard talks. The talks themselves are exceptionally well presented, and amount to short mini-lectures that can be quite effective. 
				        Chemistry Explained:  Foundations and applications - At first glance, this site appears to be just an A-Z index to a series of short definitions of the many topics it covers, but clicking on the name of the topic itself brings up a fairly detailed (but anonymously composed) description or exposition of the subject. 
				       			      
					   New or Revised Chem1 Virtual Textbook modules 
					   The  reference text for General Chemistry  is intended to serve as a supplement to or substitute for a conventional textbook. It is licensed for non-commercial use under Creative Commons. 
					   
					    Properties of Gases : understanding matter at its simplest (2011) - A complete rewrite of the original 2003 version. 
					    Kinetics and Dynamics of Chemical Change  - (2010-2011) Rate of a reaction, differential and integrated rate laws, half-life, collision theory, activation energy and the Arrhenius equation, elementary processes, reaction mechanisms and chain reactions, catalysis and catalysts. 
	 				  
					  
				        Blogging the Periodic Table  -  "a series of 28 "Wild, weird, wonderful stories about the elements that make up our universe" by Sam Kean. This series appeared in  Slate  in mid-2010. 
				        Elementymology & Elements Multidict  - Speaking of the periodic table, what do they call the element strontium in Georgia (the country, not the state!)? Answer: ???????????. If gems like this fascinate you, have a look at this site by Peter van der Krogt, which  is all about the element names and their origins, not just in English, but in 97 different languages. 
				        Online Books on Chemistry at the Library of Congress  - this extensive index is arranged by LC catalog number. From Boyle's Skeptical Chymist to my own Chem1 Virtual Textbook, it's all here! And if you wonder how all those Chemistry catalog numbers starting with Q are organized,  see here . 
				        WikiBooks on Chemistry  - Many topics in general chemistry are covered here, and are worth looking at. But as in any "wiki-" type project to which anyone can contribute, the quality is variable, and the visual design is primitive. 
				        Welcome to Educational Vodcasting!  - "This site is devoted to teaching educators how to use podcasts and vodcasts to increase student achievement. This is the brainchild of Jonathan Bergmann and Aaron Sams who are pioneers in the field of using vodcasts in the classroom. They have devised a new method of teaching called Pre-Vodcasting. In this model, students watch vodcasts at home and class time is spent in engaging hands-on activities and directed problem solving." 
				        ChemPrime  is an NSF-sponsored attempt to illustrate the practical applications of chemical principles. It is set up as a Wiki, to which anyone can contribute. The index is very well organized, but suffers from too many entries (Gay-Lussac's law in Foods?) that lead nowhere. See also this ACS Symposium book chapter abstract by Ed Vitz entitled  Developing ChemPRIME:  Transforming the Didactics and Pedagogy of the General Chemistry Course with a Wiki Text. 
				        Chemistry, life, the universe & everything (CLUE) project  - this ambitious site by two well-known chemistry educators provides readings which are intended to present various Chemistry topics in a broader context, in the hope that this will motivate students to master the underlying chemistry. 
				        ChemPaths: Student Resources for General Chemistry  - "This site is the Student Access Portal to many of the  Chemistry Education Digital Library  collections, and has been built to assist instructors in providing a means to bring all of these multimedia resources into one cohesive package ready for student-use." 
				        PhET Interactive Science Simulations  - This NSF-sponsored site at U Colorado Boulder serves as a clearinghouse for simulation programs and solicits contributions from developers. A fair number of  Chemistry simulations  are available for download. 
				        Atomic Weights of Ten Chemical Elements About to Change  - and you thought that atomic weights were forever? See this December 2010 news release from the US Geological Survey! 
				        General Chemistry Notes  - According to the blurb on this commercial site, these note are "written by actual chemistry professors [and are] designed to combine both a student's lecture notes AND textbook materials into one easy-to-read and easy-to-understand format. When one downloads the entire set, 14-page samples of notes for each topic can be viewed without charge.

				    First It Was Song Downloads. Now It’s Organic Chemistry.  (N. Y. Times, July 2008) "All forms of print publishing must contend with the digital transition, but college textbook publishing has a particularly nasty problem on its hands.
