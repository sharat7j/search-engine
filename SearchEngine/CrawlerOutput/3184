				 Welcome to our "Twenty-2-One Golf" comedy experiment. You are invited to join us and help write the rules.     Twenty-2-One Golf is a self-esteemed based scoring system for golfers at all levels of their game. Twenty-2-One Golf is about getting better at enjoying your mistakes on the golf course.   Official Twenty-2-One golf shirts are available here.    Copyright 2010 Big Song Entertainment              Share this on:

				If you speak while another golfer's putt  is rolling on the green toward the hole, and you cheer that ball into the hole, leading one to false belief that the putt is actually going to drop (and the putt misses  the hole)...you've been "RANKED"!
