		 Simple GET 
		That said, there is an easy HTTP oriented API to locate IP addresses and Geocode them. If you don't supply the "?ip=aa.bb.cc.dd" bit, then the ip address lookup of the calling machine will be located instead (here, the aa,bb,cc,dd are decimal digits). If you add &position=true to the end of the URL then latitude and longitude will be returned also. Both HTML and XML formats are supplied for your convenience.

		 Country Flag 
		Paste the following code into your HTML to get a country flag of the ip address. The database is significantly more accurate (it ought to be 100%) for countries than for cities. It would be nice if y'all would make the flag a link to the www.hostip.info home page (http://www.hostip.info/) so they can come by if they're interested - it'll only benefit you in the long run.  After all, the results get more accurate as more visitors submit their IP addresses!
		  

		Flag of visitor's location:

 <IMG SRC="http://api.hostip.info/flag.php" BORDER="0" ALT="IP Address Lookup">

<A HREF="http://www.hostip.info">
