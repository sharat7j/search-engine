 Injuries have causes -- they don't simply befall us from fate or bad luck. 

 To prevent injuries it is necessary to have information about the factors that contribute to their occurrence. With this information we may understand the options for prevention. Effective injury prevention requires a multifaceted, multidisciplinary approach.

 



 The Injury Prevention Web hosts the Web sites of several  agencies and organizations  working to prevent injuries. This site contains a weekly  literature update  of recent journal articles and agency reports,  injury data  for every U.S. state, more than  1400 links  to government and non-profit injury prevention sites worldwide, suggestions of  books  for your library, and the gateway for information about scheduled  NIITS  teleconference sessions.
