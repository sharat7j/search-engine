							Getting away from it all by not going too far away seems harder and harder in the 21st century.

							  Teravista Grows up as Area Around it Grows Out

							  Sorenstam & Faxon Put the 'Pro' in 'Pro Golfer  
							Annika Sorenstam has still got the magic.Hundreds of delighted fans got to see that first-hand when she and the PGA Tour's Brad Faxon visited Forsgate Country Club in Monroe Township, N.J., to host the club's annual Charity Classic last month. Everyone came away deeply impressed by Annika the person as well as Annika the professional golfer on every level. She was exactly how golf fans like their Sunday heroes - affable, accessible, and engaging, and she charmed everyone with her grace, class, and sincerity. She had wit, sparkle, and - man alive! - did she still have game.

							  Pat Bradley Enjoys the Limelight with Nephew  
							Pat Bradley has been getting lots of phone calls from reporters since August. Retired from the LPGA Tour since 2004, the six-time major champion and Hall-of-Famer has been in demand since her nephew, Keegan, captured last summer's PGA Championship.

							  Do Clothes Really Make the Man?  
							Give or take a century or so, what we know as golf was first engaged regularly by sheepherders in Scotland. Holland, China and France may dispute the game's origins, but history has laid it on the Scots. That works for me.
								 
						
								
						
					
						
						

							  Woes of Prose  
							Cybergolf may be the wrong venue for what I am about to write, but I think it has been around long enough to survive this tale. On the other hand, I must confess to an element of guilt, much like the "Announcers' Jinx," whereby they rave about a player's prowess through a tournament only to have him or her miss crucial putts and tumble off the leaderboard.

But that's just how cool the Cavendish Trails on Prince Edward Island (PEI) in Atlantic Canada are, 60 kilometers of shoreline climbs and dips containing cross-country tracks that wind around inlets and ponds, through balsa forests and over bridges.

We had driven a number of miles off a major highway leading into eastern Pennsylvania and through some of the prettiest, albeit deserted, countryside in the Poconos. We worked the car slowly up a winding and steep hill, rounded a sharp corner and there, like a world unto itself, was our destination.

I hadn't, and was told I would be starting on the first tee of the shotgun start, and that I would be playing in a foursome with Mike Keiser.

							  Old Head: A New Irish Experience  
							Despite its name, Old Head, which opened in 1997, is a newborn babe compared to these others, but it's remarkably mature and, like the finest Irish whiskeys, will get better with age. While the big names offer their own brand of links golf, Old Head boasts some of the most spectacular vistas found anywhere in the world.
  
Built on 220 acres that jut out into the Atlantic Ocean on a thin land mass that connects Kinsale to the course, Old Head is like playing on a little diamond-shaped island within an island. The property is surrounded by water and 300-foot-high cliffs that give the Ireland's Ring of Kerry a run for its money scenery-wise. If you're looking for a true links experience, the above courses offer that. But at Old Head, you're assured of an unforgettable visual experience as well.

Rick discusses his experiences on and off several golf courses, and lends his personal observations of an exotic country in the Far East. Based on what he chronicles in this Thai adventure, we don?t believe Rick will ever be the same.

							  Penultimate Holes Play Crucial Role in Golf Design & Tournaments  
							Oftentimes great golf competitions and even club matches come down to the final hole. Most golfers and many architects believe you can't have a great golf course without an outstanding finishing hole. But frequently, crucial events play out on the penultimate hole - the 17th - and many of those events have been burned into the memory of golf fans over the years.

I have enjoyed the process and hopefully you have had a few chuckles with me.

							  Prediction: Two American Players Destined for LPGA Tour in 2011  
							The Futures Tour season doesn't even begin until mid-March, but I will go out on a limb and predict that two players will finish the season in the top five on the money list in 2010 and earn a spot on the LPGA Tour in 2011. The top five finishers on the Futures Tour's money list earn automatic entry into the LPGA and "full" playing status for the following year. 
								 
						
								
						
					
						
						

							  2010: A Pivotal Year for LPGA

Sizable question marks, monumental challenges, and bigger potential opportunities await the tour as the 2010 season approaches. The short-term and long-range future of the tour will be affected by the performance of players in the upcoming year, and decisions by the tour's new leadership will be crucial.

							  The Story behind Royal Porthcawl  
							Porthcawl is situated 30 miles west of Cardiff and 22 miles east of Swansea. It is set on the South Wales coast overlooking the Bristol Channel and, with a number of beaches around the town, has evolved into a seaside town since the Victorian era and remains one of Wales' most enduring holiday resorts. 
								 
						
								
						
					
						
						

							  Golf in Wales  
							Editor's Note: This is a first in a series of articles by Byron Kalies, a Welshman who will be releasing his new book, "From Tenby to Celtic Manor: a Cultural History of Golf in Wales," in spring 2010. With this installment, Byron discusses how the game established its deep roots in his native country.
  
Golf in Wales will not begin and end with the 2010 Ryder Cup. There are other courses in Wales apart from Celtic Manor. There are also golfers in Wales not called Ian Woosnam. For a country the size of 8,000 square miles (smaller than all American states apart from Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island), and a population of just under 3 million, there are 176 golf courses. This is perfectly adequate for our needs - after all, we're not Scotland are we?
  
However, the Ryder Cup will come to Wales in October 2010 and, for a week or so, Wales will be the focus of the golfing world. For any golfer that has been trapped in a bunker for the past decade or so, the Ryder Cup is a three-day competition between teams representing Europe and the U.S. It is the world's third-biggest sporting occasion, surpassed only by the Olympic Games and soccer's World Cup and watched by billions around the world. In 2010 the matches will be played on Celtic Manor Resort's new "Twenty Ten" course in Newport, Wales, the first facility specifically designed to host the biennial event.

							  Writer Ventures Down Under for the World Masters Games   
							I recently returned from Australia where I played in the World Masters Games golf tournament. The World Masters Games (hereafter referred to as "WMG" so I don't have to keep writing "World Masters Games" over and over) featured nearly 30,000 athletes in 28 sports at venues spread all over Sydney and its suburbs - or its "surrounds" as the Aussies call them. 
								 
						
								
						
					
						
						

							  An Open Letter to the International Olympic Committee  
							Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of the I.O.C.,
    
Wake up and smell the Hybrids, folks, it is time to play golf. Time to put this sport back on the Olympic list, to tee it up with the trumpets blaring and the flags flying and the medals-podium looming and nationalism bleeding and braying all over the course. The Olympic credo, "Citius, Altius, Fortius" should be cheerfully expanded to "Citius, Altius, Fortius, Birdius," or loosely translated: "higher, faster, stronger and who has the balls to go for the 18th green in two with the world watching and a gold medal in the balance?"

							  Writer Takes on another Batch of Top 100 Courses  
							Editor's Note: The author of this piece is on a noble quest to play the top-100 golf courses in the world. He's not looking at just the top 100, but three different lists: public and overall (both public and private) in the U.S., and those ranked highly from around the world. With this installment, Simon discusses a memorable trip he took in fall 2009 to New York and rounds at six of that state's most fabled - and hard-to-get-on - private courses.

							  Putt with a Snooker Player's Confidence  
							Harrison Frazar shot a 59 during his fourth round at the six-round PGA Q-School. His last putt was a tap-in. Despite his heroics, Frazar didn't automatically assume he'd earn a 2009 PGA Tour card (he did, finishing as the medalist by a margin of eight shots).
								 
						
								
						
					
						
						

							  Will the Triple Crown of Golf be Awarded this Year?   
							By winning the U.S. Open, Angel Cabrera took the first step in taking home the "Triple Crown in Golf." Though not as familiar to today's golfers as the Grand Slam - the winning of the current four majors (Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA Championship), the Triple Crown was one of the game's early-day achievements. If one believes in celestial links, it appears that Angel may have what it takes.

							Last January, I entered my essay in the Golf Digest/U.S. Open contest, explaining in 100 words or less why I feel I could break 100 at Torrey Pines this June. My essay simply stated how I grew up on a golf course and have a number of club pros, course owners and instructors in my family tree. With all this golf in my bloodline, I decided to become an artist.

							  'At what age should I start my child taking golf lessons?'  
							I've been asked this question a lot, and as a golf professional, its one I'll undoubtedly be asked countless more times. Most often, the inquiry comes from a young mother or father whose toddler recently picked up a 9-iron and showed great joy in thrashing around the backyard chasing a little white ball. When the little Tasmanian devil is asked if he enjoys golf, he'll answer with an enthusiastic "Yes!" and take another wild chop.
								 
						
								
						
					
						
						

							  Lo, the Practice Green  
							Lo the practice green: An area of closely mown grass containing six to nine holes and those cute miniature pins sticking out of them. Every course has at least one, as do a lot of driving ranges and practice facilities. If we could all get ourselves to spend more time there we would assuredly become much better golfers. And yet, most of us trudge off to the driving range to work on getting rid of our hooks, slices and dreaded shanks (oops, I didn't mean to write that word out loud).

							  Marin CC & Harbottle Collaborate on $5.6 Million Renovation    
							Marin Country Club, located just north of San Francisco, will begin a $5.6 million golf course renovation in early May under the direction of Tacoma, Wash.-based Architect John Harbottle. The project will include a new irrigation system; drainage upgrades; the reconstruction of all 18 greens, all bunkers and tees, the practice putting green; and a re-grassing of the entire course. From start to finish, the renovation of the 50-year-old course is projected to take nine months.

							  Ready Golf & The Point Man  
							The sad consequence of our playing partner leaving the group got even sadder when his brute of a brother-in-law took his place. That's when our happy little foursome went into a tailspin. Not to be unkind, but you wouldn't want to be caught in a confined space with this hulking descendant of Man - he could suck the oxygen right out of a clubhouse.

I'm standing by the putting green, watching a few of the world's 64 top-ranked players when, suddenly, Tiger Woods casually strolls across the practice green.
								 
						
								
						
					
						
						

							  As Good as the Game Gets  
							Was it Socrates who tells us that the unexamined golf swing is not worth living with . . . or was that Jack Nicklaus? Well, whoever it was, for the average golfer it's a haunting reminder to spend more time on the driving range. Alas, for me there's a bizarre distraction which often prevents me from ever getting to the driving range.

							  The Blackbush Causeway Coast Amateur ? Golf Adventures in Northern Ireland  
							As the dismal month of May slowly and thankfully comes to a close in New England and Memorial Day weekend approaches, we are reminded that we are programmed to do certain tasks which are associated with this time of year. Those of us fortunate enough to own property at the beach will fight the traffic and make the pilgrimage to Cape Cod or Hampton Beach to open up the cottages and homes for the upcoming summer months.
								 
						
								
						
					
						
						

							  The Return of a Looper  
							The adventure began back in December while I was comfortably sipping on a tall Skyy Vodka Seabreeze cocktail with family and friends. You might be wondering why I was drinking a summertime cocktail in the dead of winter. As I?ve aged and, hopefully, matured, I have drifted away from the excessive consumption of Bud Lights in favor of a nice vodka concoction, regardless of the season. At the tender age of 46, I?ve yet to acquire a taste for fine wines, so I stick to my big blue bottle of Skyy regardless of the temperature outside.
