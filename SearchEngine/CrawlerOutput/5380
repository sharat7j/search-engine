         Summary 

        
            
             
                
                    
                    
                         
                            Abstract: 
                            The Department of Atmospheric Sciences (DAS) at the University   of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) would like to announce the   release of the 2nd edition of the Weather World 2010 (WW2010)   Educational CD-ROM. This resource is being constructed to   provide local access to the high-graphics version our entire   collection of Internet-based educational resources developed   through our participation in  ... NSF's Collaborative Visualization   Project (CoVis). Most of these resources are currently available   in the Online Guides.     The CD-ROM includes the following features:     INSTRUCTIONAL MODULES - that use multimedia and the flexible   nature of the web to enhance the impact of educational   resources. These modules introduce and explain fundamental   topics in Meteorology (Pressure, Severe Storms, El Niqo,   Forecasting etc.), Remote Sensing (Radars and Satellites) and   how some of these aspects fit into the Hydrologic Cycle.     NOTE: The only resources found online and not on the CD-ROM are   the Tropical Cyclone tracker and 3-D VRML Hurricane. They will   still be accessible online from the CD-ROM.     ARCHIVED WEATHER DATA - and case studies of memorable weather   events like Hurricane Andrew, Storm of the Century and the April   19, 1996 Illinois Tornado Outbreak. Each case contains relevant   weather images, storm histories, photographs and eye-witness   accounts.     STUDENT PROJECTS & ACTIVITIES - (complete with answer keys)   that provide teachers with a meaningful way of integrating the   data and instructional resources into the classroom.     REAL-TIME WEATHER DATA - will also be accessible from selected   pages of the CD-ROM to allow the user to apply what they've   learned to current weather conditions. These pages will link to   relevant weather products accessible through our WW2010 web   server.     EFFICIENT NAVIGATION - that allows users to move between   hundreds of pages with only a few clicks and return easily.     These resources will be accessible from the CD-ROM by using any   standard web browser and the interface will be nearly identical   to their online counterparts. Therefore the same CD-ROM can be   used on a Macintosh or an PC.

These  resources were developed through our participation in NSF's  Collaborative Visualization (CoVis) project which supports  project-based learning of the sciences for grade levels  9-12. These resources have already been implemented in a  number of CoVis classrooms and have been modified based upon  student and teacher feedback.
