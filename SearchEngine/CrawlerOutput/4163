Organic Reaction Quizzes and Summaries 

 
  Organic Reaction Quizzes and Summaries

 The summaries and quizzes which can be selected below are designed to assist organic chemistry students in the review of the basic reactions; they are similar to the summaries in the text and include references to it.  We have chosen to use specific examples, rather than R-group notation, so that you will see the reactions in context in a real, but simple, molecule.  Note that every reaction should occur twice in this summary, once under "reactions" and once under "synthesis"; for your convenience, the functional groups are separated into semester groups, but some reactions may occur once in each.  Reactions for which the mechanism  or stereochemistry is an important part of your learning have Mechanism! or Stereochemistry! highlighted. Study hints  by this professor  and a  successful Towson University student ; hints provided for a  Biochemistry course  also apply since the skills are the same.

 
 These summaries and quizzes, which are still under construction, come without guarantee;  please let me know if you find an error .  I confess that myself and several students had fun and learned a lot putting these together.  We hope they are some assistance. Page down to see the selection.

To use these reactant categories more effectively you might want to  review acids and bases  , oxidation and reduction in general, or learn or review how to  calculate oxidation states and balance equations for organic compounds. 


 
   Study Hints 
  Every student should make a personal summary in a style that suits her or his own learning style - whatever works for you, do it. Several methods have been found successful for learning reactions:  
 
 Flash cards with reagents on one side and products on the other;
 Flash cards with organic and inorganic reagent on one side and organic reagent and product on the other;  these cards give you two quizes per card;
 For each functional group, a page listing reactions (and examples) and a page listing methods of synthesis;
 
Summaries are most effective if you make them yourself.  So use the summaries in the files above to check your own rather than generate them.
 Summaries cannot substitute for working problems - from the text, from old exams, from the Internet.  
Working problems is especially effective if you treat the problems as an exam, and do not look up the answers until you have completed a set.  The quizes in the files above are drills, and are less complex than those in the text or on the exams.   
 Additional study hints are provided in the lecture syllabi (go back to the  Organic Chemistry menu  to select the syllabus), by  a successful student  and on some Internet sites such as this one for  Biochemistry.

Suggestions for improvement should be sent by e-mail to  
lsweeting@towson.edu .  Justin D. Chandler is the co-creator of these pages, and we had help from Adeola Adeyeye, Arh Lam,  Nathanael McCurley, Bryan Bornfriend, Keith Leadbetter and Shannon Devine.  If you wish to participate (there is still lots to be done, such as scaling the pictures of the reagents and adding other texts) contact Dr. Sweeting.
