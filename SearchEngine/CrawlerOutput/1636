   Mid-Ocean Ridges 
           
    The
                mid-ocean ridge is a continuous chain of volcanoes on the ocean
                floor where lava erupts and the crust of the Earth is created.
                Nearly every day, somewhere on the crest of the mid-ocean ridge,
                there is likely to be an eruption of lava or an intrusion of
                magma that builds the ocean crust.

                    Flows   
            From Expedition 5: 
When a volcano erupts, the molten rock (or magma) that comes out of the Earth
is called lava. Lava is the most common form of material erupted from volcanoes
that form oceanic islands like the Galápagos and Hawaiian Islands.  Learn
