				   Creighton University's  Online Master's in Health Care Ethics 
				   The Ideal Interdisciplinary Health Care Degree Online 
					 Headlines about health care reform, spiraling costs for treatment and medicine, and disparities in the availability and quality of health care have led to more awareness of health care ethics. The online Master of Science in Health Care Ethics from Creighton University educates students in this complex field with few easy answers, touching on historical, cultural, philosophical, political, economic and legal aspects of an area also known as bioethics. 
			    An interdisciplinary degree offered through Creighton's Center for Health Policy and Ethics (CHPE), the online M.S. in Health Care Ethics is an ideal degree for those who work in health care or related fields and want to become more effective in their current roles, such as physicians, nurses, hospital administrators, public health managers and chaplains.
