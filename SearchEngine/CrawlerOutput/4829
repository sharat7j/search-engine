  Here
are just some of the great Testimonials I receive from web site
visitors and newsletter subscribers. I really appreciate all the
wonderful feedback and complements. It keeps me going. Thank you, Scott
Turton, Webmaster of Intelligentedu.com
  
Thanks for a great site, Scott. Just found and bookmarked it - I'll be
back again and again. Nice to see sites that are in the true spirit of
the net. Best, R. 
 I
am using the internet to get properly trained because I can't afford
live training here. Your site is the best I have found so far. Your
efforts to provide costless computer literacy is certainly useful. M.Q. 
 Greetings
to All. Just a few lines to let you know that your site is a GREAT
ONE!! The information provided deserves praise to all involved...Thank
you very much for sharing this with us. Sincerely Yours, B.A. 
 Hi
Scott: What a wonderful site for all the people of the world. I have
done an electronic servicing course for 2 yrs, and I have now got the
job as a PC technician, which was a difficult thing, but for the help
from this web site. I am the king of P.C. now so you are welcome in
(England) any time. S.A. 
 What a great idea and site. Many thanks. A.H. 

 Just
wanted to say Thank You for proving once again that one need not remain
in the dark if you're willing to work a little...what an exhaustive,
well-structured resource you have put at our disposal...I personally
believe that anyone with an ounce of incentive should quickly make this
site their homepage. Best, J.F. 

 Hi
webmaster: I am writing you to say your site and newsletter are really
great darn good stuff. I have been receiving the Newsletter
Subscription for the past four months. It has helped me a lot. It is
great. This is an Excellent Site for everyone's knowledge. Thanks. S.R. 

 I
have surfed every search engine I could find and the sources you list
in your letter are superb. I never was able to find the things you
show. I think it is a great thing you are doing...Because of the
listings in your newsletters I am learning html and hope to learn perl
and javascript so I can begin making web pages for a company. You have
given me a new lease on life and I certainly do appreciate it. Take
care, R.S. 
 Dear
Scott Turton, I commend your website for undertaking the task of
bringing the IT knowledge to the grassroots. Your website has done more
good than you expect because in most part of the world, like my part,
the knowledge is elusive and in some cases very expensive. I personally
do not know how to thank you for the priceless information you have
sent to me, though my first newsletter is the April edition, I say a
big thank you and please keep on the good work. Thank you, faithfully
M.A. 

 
 
 Is free training really a bargain? Check out this  informative article  at nwfusion.com. The author interviewed Scott Turton to gather much of the information he presents.
