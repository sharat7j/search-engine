Bibliography of body mass index BMI references 
 
 
  
 

 
  
   Bibliography of Body Mass Index BMI body fat references. 
    This is not a boring bibliography! (OK, it might be slightly 
    dull). Beside each article listed about Body Mass Index (BMI), there are my 
    personal comments, which are sometimes critical. There are graphics 
    and charts to illustrate my point of view. Become an expert - read 
    and see why experts disagree sometimes. 
   Students of  body mass index  
    will find many of the world's important scientific publications about body 
    composition listed here.
