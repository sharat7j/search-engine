 Welcome to Our Website 
 We completed our new website in January 2010 and closed off our previous ".com" site. Each page link on the previous site has been redirected to the appropriate new web page. 
 As we continue to improve this site, we welcome your feedback! Toward the bottom of most web pages, there is a link that reads, "Make content suggestion or comment to website editors." Clicking this link will allow you to give input on that page or topic. If you have more general comments, you may also use the last link ("Make Content Suggestion") in the Reference Menu at the bottom of the right column of every page. 
 Arizona continues to be a leader in developing and implementing solar technologies. As the Arizona Solar Center, we look forward to remaining a key information resource for you regarding all things solar in Arizona!
