 Beyond Discovery?: The Path from Research to Human Benefit is a series of articles that trace the origins of important recent technological and medical advances. Each story reveals the crucial role played by basic science, the applications of which could not have been anticipated at the time the original research was conducted.  
 This site is no longer actively updated, but is maintained by the Marian Koshland Science Museum of the National Academy of Sciences.
