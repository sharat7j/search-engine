            Mission 
            Exploring for Mid-Ocean Ridge Eruptions  
            Join us for a 47-day cruise aboard the Research Vessel Melville              during
              Dive & Discover’s Expedition 3—as scientists
              probe the dark depths of the eastern Pacific Ocean, looking for
              new volcanic eruptions on the crest of the  mid-ocean
              ridge . 
               The mid-ocean ridge is the Earth’s
                  greatest mountain range. It is made of many active underwater
                  volcanoes, where erupting lava cools when it hits cold seawater
                and solidifies to create new seafloor. 
               Seafloor lava flows have strange and wonderful shapes. Some
                look like they have been squeezed out of a tube of toothpaste
                to form long cylinders with deep grooves in them. Others form
                big, cracked pillows of rock that look like overstuffed sofas.
                Some lava flows look like ropy swirls of black taffy. 
               How did these lava flows form? When did they
                  erupt? How do they build up to form the ocean crust of the
                  Earth? How are hydrothermal vents, like the ones studied during
                  Dive and Discover’s
                first two cruises, related to these undersea eruptions and lava
                flows? [See  Expedition
                1  or  Expedition 2 ] 
               To answer these questions, scientists first
                  have to find where underwater volcanoes are actively erupting.
                  But in the vast, dark, deep ocean, how do you catch a submerged
                  volcano in the act? Scientists have come up with an exciting
                  new way that may work: they have set up an experimental array
                  of hydrophones to monitor thousands of kilometers of the mid-ocean
                  ridge and “listen” for
              and locate sound waves generated by underwater volcanic eruptions.

                    ARGO II                   
                Over the past three years, data collected
                  from the hydrophones have given us intriguing evidence that
                  seafloor eruptions have taken place at four locations along
                  the  East Pacific Rise , the mid-ocean ridge in the Pacific Ocean.
                  This expedition will investigate whether eruptions have indeed
                  occurred at those four sites and prove whether the hydrophones
                  are reliable “ears” in
              the ocean. 
               A team of geologists and geophysicists from
                  six institutions and government laboratories -- led by Dan
                  Fornari, Mike Perfit and Maya Tolstoy -- will survey the
                  target sites, between the Equator and about 10oN, aboard Scripps
                  Institution of Oceanography’s
                RV Melville. Using the DSL-120 sonar and Argo II imaging
                systems, they will make detailed sonar and photographic maps
                of the seafloor.  They will also
                use dredges, rock corers and CTD (conductivity, temperature,
                depth) instruments to sample lava flows and seawater, and sample
                hydrothermal vents that may have been created when the eruptions
                occurred.

               Objectives 
                The primary objective of Expedition 3 is to study places on
                the seafloor where volcanic eruptions have occurred very recently.
                  These underwater eruptions are one of the most fundamental
                  processes that shape the Earth and life on it. They are the
                  source of lava that creates new seafloor and of chemicals that
                  provide energy for exotic life in the deep. To really understand
                  how our planet works, we must understand where volcanic eruptions
                  take place, how long they last, and how they affect the seafloor, seawater,
              and deep-sea organisms.  
               Scientists know that volcanic eruptions are happening all the
                time at different places on the mid-ocean ridge axis. But to
                study the new lava flows, we first have to find them. That is
                very difficult to do, because the eruptions occur in the dark
                depths of the vast ocean, where scientists have had no eyes or
              ears. Until now that is!  
               Our colleagues at the National Oceanic and
                  Atmospheric Administration’s
                (NOAA) Hatfield Marine Center, in Newport, Oregon have developed
                an exciting new way to “listen” for sound waves generated
                by volcanic eruptions over thousands of kilometers of the mid-ocean
                ridge axis. It is called the Autonomous Hydrophone Array (or
                AHA), and consists of six hydrophones spaced many hundreds of
                kilometers apart. The hydrophones are placed in a special part
                of the upper ocean between 600 m and 1200 m depth, called the
                SOFAR (SOund Fixing And Ranging) channel. This channel acts almost
                like a pipeline for sounds in the ocean. Sound waves travel straight
                through the SOFAR channel without dispersing into ocean layers
                above and below. The sound waves can travel thousands of miles
                and still be detected. Since the mid-1940s when the SOFAR channel
                was discovered, scientists, engineers and the military from different
                countries have used this underwater pipeline to listen for submarines,
                whales, and to study how sound travels in the ocean. Now ocean
                scientists are using it to study volcanic processes on the mid-ocean
                ridge crest.  
               Hydrophones record sound waves that are generated
                by the cracking of the ocean crust as molten rock, or magma,
                travels to the seafloor within the ocean crust, or as the lava
                erupts on the seafloor. In 1996, six hydrophones were put out
                in the eastern Pacific Ocean to listen for volcanic eruptions
                between about 20°N latitude and 300°S latitude, a range of over
                3000 miles (5400 kilometers). Every six months, NOAA scientists
                and technicians have been going out on ships to pick up the hydrophones,
                collect the data that they had recorded, put new batteries in
                the recorders, and put the hydrophones back in place so they
                can continue to monitor the ridge crest for eruptions. 
               Scientists in our research group have now
                  analyzed the hydrophone data collected over the past three
                  years and have located four sites on the East Pacific Rise
                  axis between the Equator and 10oN latitude where we think seafloor
                  lava eruptions have taken place. Will the AHA prove to be reliable “ears,” or
                  are they giving us misleading signals? Answering this question
                  is the primary goal of our expedition. 
               At each of the four target locations, we will use several different
                survey methods and types of sampling equipment to determine if
                recent volcanic eruptions have occurred and to see what effects
                those eruptions may have had on the seafloor, seawater, and seafloor
                life. 
               Surveys at each site will include: 
               
                 A detailed multibeam bathymetric survey
                    so that we can make a map of seafloor depths over large areas.
                    We bounce sound waves off the seafloor, which return to receivers
                    on the ship. The higher the seafloor, the faster the waves
                    return; the deeper the seafloor, the longer it takes for
                  the sound waves to return. In this way, we can make bathymetric
                    maps of the seafloor’s
                  topography. If the lava flows have built big structures (10 to
                  20 meters and bigger than a football field in area), such a map
                  might give us a clue as to where an eruption has occurred. These
                  data also provide a critical “road” map so that
                  we can safely navigate our next two types of mapping vehicles
                  along the jagged seascape. 
                 
                 A survey using the DSL-120 side-looking
                    sonar system that probes the seafloor with high-frequency
                    sound waves and gives us “images” of
                  the seafloor terrain.
                  These tell us a lot about where lava has erupted on the ridge
                  crest and how lava flows across the seafloor. This vehicle
                    is towed 100 m above the seafloor and is connected to the
                    ship with a fiber optic cable so that scientists on board
                    the ship can collect data and “see” the seafloor as the vehicle
                  is towed over the seafloor. 
                 
                 The Argo II imaging system provides the final
                  proof of actually seeing new lava. Argo II collects video and
                  digital pictures of the seafloor, and is towed only 10 m above
                  the seafloor. It also
                  is connected to the ship by the fiber optic cable, so scientists
                  see the images coming back from the ocean floor in real time. 
                 
                 Once we find a new lava flow, we will take samples of the
                  volcanic rock using dredges and rock cores. The lava will be
                  analyzed on shore to tell us what its chemical composition
                  is; this will also help us determine how old it is. We will
                  also use a CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth) rosette system
                  which will allow us to determine the salinity and temperature
                  of the water, and also to sample the water near the seafloor
                  for later analysis. If we observe any hydrothermal vents we
                  will try to sample the water near them and will use the dredges
                  to collect some of the sulfide minerals and the animals that
                  live near the vents.
