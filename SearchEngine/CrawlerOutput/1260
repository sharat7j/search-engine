     Safety note 
	 For all of the activities published in Science in School, we have tried to check that all recognised hazards have been identified and that suitable precautions are suggested. Users should be aware, however, that errors and omissions can be made, and safety standards vary across Europe and even within individual countries. 
	  Therefore, before undertaking any activity, users should always carry out their own risk assessment. In particular, any local rules issued by employers or education authorities MUST be obeyed, whatever is suggested in the Science in School articles. 
	  Unless the context dictates otherwise, it is assumed that: 
	 
     Practical work is carried out in a properly equipped and maintained science laboratory 
	   Any electrical equipment is properly maintained  
	   Care is taken with normal laboratory operations such as heating 
	   Good laboratory practice is observed when chemicals or living organisms are used 
	   Eye protection is worn whenever there is any recognised risk to the eyes 
	   Pupils and/or students are taught safe techniques for activities such as handling living organisms, hazardous materials and equipment.
