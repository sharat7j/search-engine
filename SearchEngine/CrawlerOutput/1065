       When To Worry About Smart Kids And Drugs 
       Do children with high IQs grow up to be drug abusers? That was the startling headline on a new research study. But lack of parental supervision and untreated mental health problems are far more likely to be issues, and those are things that parents can fix.

       Feds Want To Make Farming Safer For Kids 
       The Labor Department has proposed changes that would outlaw farm kids under the age of 16 from driving tractors, branding cattle and handling pesticides.

But statics show kids who work on farms are six times more likely to be killed than children working in other industries. Peggy Lowe of Harvest Public Media reports.

       Pizza As A Vegetable? It Depends On the Sauce 
       The U.S. House unveiled a spending bill that would unravel some of the Obama administration's efforts to revamp school lunches. Under the bill, pizza would still count as a vegetable. Nutrition advocates say if the rule stays, it will be a win for industry and a loss for kids.
