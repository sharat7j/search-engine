       Enlightening Science 
       The European XFEL is a research facility currently under construction in the Hamburg area, Germany. From 2015 on, it will generate extremely intense X-ray flashes to be used by researchers from all over the world. 
     
     
       The facility 
       The X-ray flashes will be produced in a 3.4-kilometre-long facility. Most of it will be housed in tunnels deep below ground. Three sites provide access to the tunnels and the experiment stations. ( More ) 
     
     
       Generation of X-ray flashes 
       Initially, a particle accelerator brings electrons to almost the speed of light. These electrons are then made to follow a tight slalom course on which they emit intense flashes of X-ray radiation. ( More ) 
     
     
       Research 
       The European XFEL will open up completely new areas of experimentation. Its X-ray flashes will allow to map atomic details of viruses, film chemical reactions and study the processes in the interior of planets. ( More ) 
     
     
       The Company 
       The European XFEL is being constructed by the European XFEL GmbH. For the construction and operation, the company collaborates closely with DESY and many other institutions.
