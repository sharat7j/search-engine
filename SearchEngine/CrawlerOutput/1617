            Mission 
              Dive and Discover’s Expedition 5 will explore the undersea
              volcanic slopes of the remote Galápagos islands of Fernandina
              and Isabela. Though best known for his theory of evolution based
              on biological observations made in the Galápagos, Charles
              Darwin was first captivated by the geology of the islands when
              he traveled there more than 160 years ago. The natural wonders
              of Galápagos volcanoes and animals led him to develop several
              scientific theories which revolutionized biological and geological
              sciences in the 19th century.   
              Now, scientists on Expedition 5 will use high-tech oceanographic
              instruments to make new geological discoveries in the Galápagos.
              They will map and sample the submarine sides of two volcanoes that
              rise more than 4,500 meters (14,760 feet) above the seafloor. The
              detailed maps will give scientists clues to understand the geologic
              history of these volcanoes. The chemistry of the  lava  will tell
              them about the Earth’s interior and how molten rock or magma
              is formed in the  mantle  and how it erupts under the ocean.

              Join scientists, students, technicians and the ship’s crew
              on board the research vessel RV Roger Revelle of the Scripps Institution
              of Oceanography as they explore the underwater slopes of volcanoes
              in the Galápagos Islands. The month-long expedition starts
              on August 24, 2001, when the ship sails from Puerto Caldera, Costa
              Rica. After a brief stop in the Galápagos Islands to take
              on personnel and explore the island, we head out to sea for 3 weeks
              to conduct our expedition. Join us!
               Objectives 
                In 1835 a young British naturalist named
                  Charles Darwin visited the Galápagos Islands during the legendary voyage
                    of HMS Beagle. Darwin’s keen observations of the islands’ singular
                    animal life inspired his revolutionary theories of biological
                evolution. But that’s just a part of the story.  
               Created by  volcanic eruptions  over the past
                  3 million years, the Galápagos Islands rise to elevations of more than
                1600 meters (5300 feet) above sea level. But these are just the
                more visible tips of much larger volcanic platforms that extend
                another 3000 meters (9800 feet) down to the seafloor! Now, scientists
                from several US research institutions and universities will explore
                the portions of these extraordinary islands that have been hidden
                by the ocean. Their mission constitutes the most comprehensive
                mapping, sampling, and deep-sea photography of the seafloor around
                the western Galápagos Islands ever done.  
               The Galápagos Archipelago stretches over 400 miles (>640
                kilometers) in the eastern Pacific Ocean near the Equator. It
                includes thirteen major islands, six smaller islands, and dozens
                of islets. Discovered in 1535 by the Bishop of Panama, Thomás
                de Berlanga, the islands served over succeeding centuries as
                a re-provisioning stop for pirates and whalers, who regrettably
                plundered the islands’ giant tortoises and introduced animals
                and plants that profoundly changed the islands’ ecology.  
               Most of the major islands of the Galápagos,
                including those we will study, have had recent eruptions. The
                Galápagos
                lie atop a hotspot -- a dot on Earth’s face where a
                narrow plume of hot mantle rocks rise from deep within the planet
                and burst through Earth’s crust to create seafloor volcanoes.
                In a way, hotspots like the Galápagos give us a rare window
                to peer into processes that we can’t easily see because
                they occur deep within the Earth.  
               Among the questions we are exploring are
                  these: Where does the magma, or molten rock, come from to feed
                  volcanic eruptions on the Galápagos? Can we find telltale chemical clues in
                magma that can teach us about the formation of Earth’s
                mantle and the early history of the Earth? How do seafloor lava
                flows eventually build islands? How does the Galápagos’ underwater
                volcanic terrain compare with that of hotspot islands, such as
                Hawaii and Iceland, and with that created by volcanoes at mid-ocean
                ridges?  
               To help answer these questions, we will study
                  the submarine flanks of the two westernmost Galápagos Islands: Isabela
                and Fernandina. We will use a multibeam sonar system mounted
                on the hull of Scripps Institution of Oceanography’s RV
                Roger Revelle to collect data to make bathymetric maps of seafloor
                topography. In addition, the University of Hawaii’s MR-1
                side-scan sonar system, which is towed behind the research ship,
                will collect data to create images of submarine lava flows that
                look almost like photographs taken from an airplane. They will
                show the locations of different lava flows and volcanic vents
                and the pathways in which lava has traveled down the undersea
                slopes.  
               Once we have mapped the seafloor around Isabela
                  and Fernandina, we will use Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution’s
                  one-of-a-kind digital deep-sea camera system to photograph
                  seafloor lava flows. Using the sonar maps and photographs as
                  guides, we will sample the seafloor lava with a dredge and
                  rock corer. The rocks initially will be described, cut, and
                  sampled on board. Their chemistry will be analyzed after the
                  cruise in several US research laboratories. 
               Each day the scientific and technical teams
                  on the ship will collect new images and samples of the undersea
                  volcanic terrain around these islands that have never been
                  seen before. Join us as we piece together the magmatic and
                  volcanic history of Galápagos
                undersea volcanoes.
