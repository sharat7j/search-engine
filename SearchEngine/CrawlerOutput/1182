	   	Fusion is the energy source of the universe, it is the process that powers the sun and the stars. Fusion research in Europe is aimed at 
		demonstrating that nuclear fusion is a viable future energy option which offers long-term, safe, and environmentally benign energy to 
		meet the needs of a growing and developing world population.
	    
	   	 
			
		 
        
	   	The European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) is an agreement between European fusion research institutions 
		and the European Commission to strengthen their coordination and collaboration, and to participate in collective activities. 
		Its activities include coordination of physics and technology in EU laboratories, the exploitation of the world's largest fusion experiment, 
		the Joint European Torus (JET) in the UK, training and career development in fusion and EU contributions to international collaborations.
