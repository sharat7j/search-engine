      The Swing Is The Thing — Jay Perkins,PGA-Bel Air Golf Center 
        
       From my experience as a golf teacher I have observed that most people try and overuse their bodies in the golf swing. Tour professionals and very skilled amateur golfers know how to use their body properly to increase swing speed in their golf swings. The average golfer or occasional golfer tries to muscle into the shot with their upper body to gain more speed. Try allowing the arms to drop down more from the top of the swing and allow the body to react to the swing of the arms vs. attempting to use the body to force or push the shaft of the club at the ball.
