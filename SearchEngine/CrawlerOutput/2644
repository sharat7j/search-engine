			Dear Colleagues,  

			November is National Alzheimer's Disease Month and National
			Family Caregivers' Month. Over 25 million Americans provide unpaid,
			long-term, care to loved ones. Care-giving is more than a one-person
			job, yet one family member most often carries the responsibility
			alone, says the National Family Caregivers Association. Today's
			newsletter focuses on issues related to aging.  
			
			Please feel free to forward this information to professional colleagues, who can sign-up for a free subscription to Friday's Progress Notes at  http://www.athealth.com/Practitioner/Newsletter/fpn_subscribe.html
