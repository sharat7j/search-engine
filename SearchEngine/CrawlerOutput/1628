			Mission 
            Collecting Deep-Sea Corals 
            Dive and Discover?s 2003 expedition will
            journey to the New England  Seamounts ,
            a chain of extinct, undersea volcanoes about 500 miles off the east
            coast of North America.  
                 
The scientific treasures the expedition seeks are deep-sea  corals ,
whose skeletons may reveal how Earth?s climate rapidly cooled or warmed
in the past. Learning how and why Earth?s  climate  shifted
in the past gives us an idea of how it might change in the future. 
     
            
            
             
            Scientists think that abrupt climate changes may
            have been caused by changes in the circulation of the deep ocean.
            In particular, they think that a cold, salty, deep  water
            mass  in the North Atlantic stopped flowing and then started flowing
            again several times in the past. Each time this flow has ?shut
            down? or ?turned on,? Earth?s climate has
            changed.  
            
                      The New England Seamounts rise thousands of meters
              up from the seafloor, right into the pathway of this deep, cold
              water mass. On the seamounts grow large populations of deep-sea
              corals. Throughout their lives, coral skeletons absorb chemicals
              from the waters they are growing in. By analyzing the coral skeletons,
              scientists can determine how old the corals are and whether the
              cold, deep water was flowing when they lived. By sampling live
              and fossil corals from the top to the bottom of the seamounts,
              they hope to find out how and when this deep water mass grew larger
              or smaller, became warmer or colder, and flowed higher or lower
              in the depths-as far back as 70,000 years ago.  
                      Expedition 7 travels to the New England Seamounts,
              a chain of extinct, undersea volcanoes about 500 miles off the
              east coast of North America. On the seamounts themselves grow one
              of the chief targets of the cruise: deep-sea corals. These are
              similar to corals found in shallow, tropical waters but they don?t
              have  symbiotic algae  that require
              light. Instead, they rely on capturing food from the water column.
              Therefore, they can grow in the darkest depths of the ocean.
                    
             
             The corals? skeletons can provide crucial
            clues to the history of Earth?s  climate ,
            which is what the cruise is all about. We hope to find out how and
            why the planet?s climate has rapidly shifted from cold to warm
            periods, and to use that information to predict how it might change
            in the future.  
                 

            
            The corals? skeletons are rich repositories of environmental information.
The biochemical composition of their skeletons is different if they grow in different
water conditions. And water conditions change as Earth?s climate does.
Like undersea tape recorders, individual corals at different depths in the ocean
have recorded how Earth?s climate has changed through time. But getting
those corals back to the lab is not the only goal of the expedition.  
     
Our broader aim is to use the New England Seamounts as a test case: What we learn
about retrieving and studying corals here will show us the best ways of getting
other corals in the future, from the deep Pacific Ocean to the waters off Antarctica.  
     
The first day the vessel Atlantis arrives at a particular seamount, it
will go back and forth over an area with  sonar  equipment
to create detailed topographic maps of the sea floor below. We call this ?mowing
the lawn?! Each map will contain all sorts of seafloor features such as
cliffs, flat areas, bowls, ridges, spires, and plains. With these maps in hand,
we will climb into the deep-diving submersible Alvin and descend to explore
the most scientifically promising underwater features.  
     
              Both Alvin and the unmanned vehicle ABE, the Autonomous
            Benthic Explorer, will collect overlapping photos of the seafloor
            that we will combine to make photomosaics. We will also generate
            additional maps that are focused on smaller areas but with much more
            detail. By putting these maps together with the large-scale maps
            made by Atlantis, we will come up with some general guidelines
            that scientists can use to find information-rich corals anywhere.
            In the future, we hope that scientists will look at topographic maps
            of the sea floor and be able to determine the likeliest places to
            find corals.  
                 
                Alvin will be doing the heavy lifting -- of both living
                and fossil corals. The principal coral we expect to find is Desmophyllum
                cristagali, which grows roughly one millimeter per year
                for several decades, or sometimes up to 150 years. Other corals
                on the seamounts are Enallopsamia rostrata and Lophelia
                pertusa.  
                 
            
            
             Once aboard, the corals will be documented, photographed,
            cleaned (the dead ones) and tissue-sampled (the living ones) for
            genetic and reproductive analysis to yield a sort of detailed family
            tree. While all the physical evidence is being processed, digital
            data will be assembled: maps, photo and video documentation, and
            information about local environmental conditions such as temperature,
            salinity, and current speed. This database of coral habitats in different
            climates is another important goal of the cruise.  
                 
The full scientific value of the corals will become apparent only partially during
Expedition 7. Atlantis has laboratory facilities that will allow scientists
to study the treasures they?ve retrieved, but many of the most perplexing
problems will take months or more to solve, after the corals have been brought
back to more sophisticated labs on shore. There, they?ll undergo more sophisticated  uranium-series  and  radiocarbon
dating  and chemical analysis. With this new chemical information in hand,
we will be able to plumb deeper into the mysteries of climate change.
