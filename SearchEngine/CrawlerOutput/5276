 Welcome 
            
 Our Golf Occasions are created to meet your personal and business objectives. 
         
 Our
custom-hosted Golf trips will take you to Scotland where you can
experience much of Golf’s history or Ireland where most of the world’s
best links courses are. Enjoy a tour through France, a Golf and Safari
venture in Kenya, or just an affordable stay in Bermuda with their
improved Golf offerings. You may also want to consider China, Thailand,
Cambodia or Vietnam, home to some of the world’s best Golf destinations. 
           
 On every trip we select the finest Golf venues. Your accommodations,
cuisine and transportation are of the highest quality.  We also
include special elements such as teaching sessions with PGA
Professionals, noted speakers on topics of business, faith, politics
and science, culinary ventures and genealogy quests. For more
information call 1-800-557-3058.
