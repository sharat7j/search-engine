  Tom Watson beats McIlroy at Sandwich

 While most folks are transfixed on Phil Mickleson’s Sunday charge at Royal St. Georges, and Darren Clarke’s best efforts to dodge and parry him and lift the Claret Jug for the first time ever, another interesting head-to-head matchup came clear as earlier groups finished up on 18 at Sandwich. 
 U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy, golf’s 22-year-old newest supernova, who briefly contended after a 69 on Friday, bogied 17 and 18 Sunday to finish at 7-over-par 287. 
 Meanwhile, five-time Open champion Tom Watson, who electrified the crowds with a one-hop, slam-dunk hole-in-one on Friday, played steady on Sunday, shooting even par over Royal St. Georges’ wind-swept back nine to close with a 72 and a 6-over 286 total. That’s one better than McIlroy. 
 McIlroy was the opening-week betting favorite. Watson is 61 years old.
