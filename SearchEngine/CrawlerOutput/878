I've rewritten the site into ASP.NET and moved many of the files.  The new location of this file is,  

 http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/alg/alg.aspx 

  

You should be taken there shortly, however, if you aren't you may click on the link provided above.  

If you arrived at this page by clicking on a link from somebody else's page you may want to let them know that the location of this page has changed so they can update their page.
