 Welcome to ChemWeb Online, the chemistry site which does it all.  If 
you are taking any Chemistry class, high school chemistry, A.P. 
level chemistry, or even college level chemistry, you will find this site 
to be an informative study helper.  The creators of this page have all 
taken a year of A.P. level chemistry.  We used this experience, and our 
internet experience, to fuse together a cooperative site where chemistry 
can be experienced.  In order to make browsing easier, we have 
created three distinct levels for browsing this web site.  They are 
1) full blown graphics, 2) mid-range graphics, and 3) text only.  We realize that the 
world (unfortunately) does not 
have an ISDN connection for everyone, so we decided that this would make it 
easier on everyone.  This page is written for Netscape web broswers, 
although it should be accessible to those with Microsoft Internet 
Explorer, or Mosaic. So get ready to enter...ChemWeb Online. 
 
 
 Please select one: 
 
  Full-Blown Graphics  
 
 This means graphic intensive! Be prepared for animated gifs, pictures 
galore, and frames - basically a wonderful graphic experience.  We highly reccomend 
at least a 33.6 baud modem, preferably an Ethernet or ISDN connection.  
Recommended broswer, Netscape 4.0. 
 
 
  Mid-Range Graphics  
 
 This means a slightly less intensive graphic experience, but the 
necessary pictures will still be there.  Anywhere from a 14.4 to a 33.6 
baud modem would be a perfect choice. Recommended broswer, Netscape 4.0. 
 
 
  Text Only  
 
 This is the text only site.  This means no pictures, just text.  The 
pictures will be available for download, though.  Use this page if you 
have a 9600 baud or slower modem.  Or use it if you just want faster 
surfing. Recommended broswer, Lynx or Netscape 4.0.
