	Disclaimer 
 
	Views and opinions expressed by authors and advertisers are not necessarily those of the editors or publisher. 
 
	We are grateful to all those who volunteer to translate articles for the Science in School website (see our  guidelines ). We are, however, unable to check the individual translations and cannot accept responsibility for their accuracy. 
 
	We make every effort to ensure that Science in School articles are factually correct. Should significant errors nonetheless occur, these will be corrected in the online (HTML) version of the article. The downloadable PDFs of the articles, however, reflect the print version and will not be changed.
