         Scientific  Peer Review         
         The  Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education (ORISE) supports federal agencies—such  as the  U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) ,  U.S. Department of Homeland Security  (DHS)  and the  National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) —by providing a customizable peer review process to ensure that government-funded  research possesses the scientific merit and feasibility that is necessary to produce  quality science. 
         
         Using  an external network of industry-specific experts, ORISE enlists the support of academic reviewers for the implementation of a variety  of peer review formats—including modest panel reviews; cost-saving, virtual  reviews using  PeerNet ; as well as large-scale  reviews involving hundreds of reviewers over multiple days.  
         ORISE  maintains process integrity through its  peer review management  by ensuring confidentiality and effectively managing conflicts of interest. This commitment to quality assurance has  guided ORISE as it has planned, organized and conducted  independent and objective reviews  and other meetings related to:
