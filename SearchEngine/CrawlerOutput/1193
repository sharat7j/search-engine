           Harnessing new technologies to maximise the potential of the individual and safeguard individuality 
         
 In the 21st Century, technology will exert unprecedented influence indirectly and directly upon the brain and the critical issue is not whether, but how, such new experiences will transform the human mind. 
 The Institute for the Future of the Mind is one of 10 research institutes in the James Martin 21st Century School made possible by a $100M benefaction to the University of Oxford with the aim of finding solutions to the biggest problems facing humanity and identifying the key opportunities of the 21st century.
