 It is a pleasure to stand upon the shore, and to see ships tost upon the
sea: a pleasure to stand in the window of the castle and to see the battle and
the adventures thereof below: but no pleasure is comparable to the standing upon
the vantage ground of truth ( a hill not to be commanded and where the air is
always clear and serene), and to see the errors, and wanderings, and mists, and
tempests, in the vale below. 
From Of Truth, Francis Bacon
