Welcome
to CaddyBytes.com?s Tournament's page for
the 2011 Omega Mission Hills World Cup of golf tournament.  The World Cup will be held in
at the Omega Mission Hills golf club in China and is again being held during Thanksgiving week of
2011 - the first time the event is being played now only as a biennial event.   
 
The World Cup of Golf joined the World Golf Championships series in 2000 and is
now run by
the International Federation of PGA Tours.   
 
In that
year the World Cup of Golf was won by the  
United States 
 team of Tiger Woods and David Duval at
the Buenos Aires Golf Club in  Buenos Aires ,  
Argentina.  Under the new format, South Africa has won it in 2002 and again
in 2003 with Japan having won the World Cup in 2001.   
 
Luke Donald and Paul Casey won the World Cup for England in 2004 and South
Africa won in 2005.  The World Cup was won by team of Bernhard
Langer and Marcel Siem in 2006.  Team Scotland won it in 2007, and Sweden
won in 2008.    
 
Italy's Molinari brothers are the defending champions having won the World Cup of Golf in
2009 and
will try to defend at the same venue - this time on the Blackstone course at the Mission Hills Golf Complex in Shenzhen, China.
