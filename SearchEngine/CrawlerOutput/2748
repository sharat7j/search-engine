           Environmental Assessments and Health Physics 
           Performing environmental assessments and independent verification is essential to building public trust and confidence in radiological cleanup. As the  U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)  and other government agencies target contaminated sites across the country for decontamination and decommissioning, strict guidelines must be followed to ensure that property is effectively remediated before being released for public or private use. 
           
            Through a combination of environmental assessments, health physics services, and radiochemistry analyses, the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) performs independent environmental assessment and verification at DOE cleanup sites across the country. ORISE  applies its advanced survey  methodology to set the standard for ensuring that remediation is performed within federal release criteria and is both accurate and thorough.
