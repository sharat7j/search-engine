         Radiation Emergency  Assistance Center/Training Site (REAC/TS) 
         Through the management of the Radiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training  Site (REAC/TS), the Oak  Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE)  positions the  U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)   as an  international leader in emergency medical response to radiation incidents. 
         
          As part of  its mission to strengthen medical response to radiation emergencies, REAC/TS staff  are available 24 hours a day/seven days a week to deploy and provide emergency  medical consultation for incidents involving radiation anywhere in the world.  REAC/TS provides direct support for the National Nuclear Security Administration's  Office of Emergency Response  and the  Federal Radiological Monitoring and Assessment  Center (FRMAC) . 
          Adding to  its depth of response and consultation capabilities, REAC/TS is uniquely qualified to  teach medical personnel, health physicists, first responders and occupational health professionals  about radiation emergency medical response. REAC/TS also operates a  cytogenetic biodosimetry laboratory , where chromosome aberration analysis is used for ionizing radiation dose assessment. 
         REAC/TS supports the international community as a  World Health Organization (WHO)  Collaborating  Center of the  Radiation Emergency Medical Preparedness and Assistance Network (REMPAN)  and as a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA)  Response Assistance Network (RANET)   for radiation accident response.
