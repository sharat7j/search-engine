  Deep Ocean Circulation  
    The
              global ocean circulation system transports heat worldwide and affects
              climate in many areas. For example, Europe would have much colder
              winters if it were not for the Gulf Stream. Winds blow surface
              waters and cause ocean currents. But the waters below the depths
              of the wind's influence flow because of differences in temperature
              and saltiness (called salinity).  Begin

Water in the ocean has different ages at different depths. Scientists can determine
these ages, and find out how long water takes to circulate through the entire
ocean and then come back to the surface.  Learn
