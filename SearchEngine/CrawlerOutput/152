					 by Allen Freeman  |  October 28, 2011    1 Comment  

					 

 Vaughn Snyder of Massillon advanced through the first stage of PGA Tour Qualifying School ‘on the number’ last Friday, finishing in a tie for the final spot at 6-under 282 at  Grasslands Golf & Country Club, Lakeland, FL . 
 Brian Unk of Lewis Center easily made it through his first stage test, finishing T10 after shooting 289 (+1) in windy conditions at  Deerwood Golf Club in Kingwood, TX . 
 And former Kent State player John Hahn of Hudson, now living full time in Las Vegas, tied for fourth place at 284 (-4) to advance from the qualifier at  Pinewild Country Club in Pinehurst, NC . 
 While Snyder, Unk and Hahn will move on to second stage events in mid-November, other local players who also tested the Q-School waters did not fare as well. [NEWLY UPDATED]  [Read more ?]

					  Heestand Receives $5K LEGT Hole In One Payment  

					 by Allen Freeman  |  October 17, 2011    7 Comments  

					 

 Parma amateur Matt Heestand received his $5,000 payment directly from the National Hole in One Association last Friday, October 14th, when the management team at NHIOA expedited the process after acknowledging the longer-than-usual delay.  
 Heestand made his hole-in-one at the Lake Erie Golf Tour event at Tam-o-Shanter Golf Course on June 30th. The LEGT had offered a $5,000 hole-in-one prize on its website to any player making an ace at any par-3 hole at any event throughout the 2011 season. But some missing and/or incorrectly completed paperwork by LEGT Director Chris Marino delayed the payment to Heestand for months.   [Read more ?]
