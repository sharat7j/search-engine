  HAINAN, China --   Matt Kuchar  and  Gary Woodland  ended the United States' 11-year drought in golf's World Cup by shooting a 5-under 67 on Sunday to win by two strokes.  The American pair fired six birdies in the alternate-shot final round at Mission Hills Blackstone course to finish at 24-under, 264 overall, notching the 24th U.S. win in the history of the tournament.     [+] Enlarge   Stuart Franklin/Getty Images Gary Woodland and Matt Kuchar helped the United States end its 11-year victory drought in golf's World Cup by shooting a 5-under 67 on Sunday.     English pair  Ian Poulter  and  Justin Rose  had the final day's best round with a 63 to tie for second at 22-under with Germany's  Martin Kaymer  and  Alex Cejka  (69).  Ireland's  Rory McIlroy  and  Graeme McDowell  led by two strokes going into the final round but could only manage an even-par 72 to finish tied for fourth with Australia, the Netherlands and Scotland.  The American victory was the first since  Tiger Woods  and  David Duval  claimed the title 11 years ago. The event was annual up until 2009, and this year's tournament was the first in the new biennial format.  "We really clicked. It's fantastic to win for the U.S.," Woodland said.  The U.S. duo built a two-point lead over Germany midway through the round and after a rare slip with a bogey at the par-3 11th, the Americans responded with birdies on the next two holes and then pars the rest of the way to claim victory.  "Undoubtedly the shots on the 12 and 13th were key. It was a great moment and to shoot a par when you expected a bogey," Kuchar said.  England seemed well out of contention heading into the final day eight shots off the lead, but soared into contention. However they needed more than one of the leading teams to falter. Instead it was only Ireland that came back to the field.  World No. 2 McIlroy was well below his best, hitting some loose shots, including a putt on the 18th which would have given Ireland a share of the runner-up check. The tournament favorites had a run of misfortune, including a penalty stroke on the 6th and four bogeys on the card.  They shared fourth with Australia's  Richard Green  and  Brendan Jones  (69), plus Scotland's  Stephen Gallacher  and  Martin Laird  (66) and the Dutch pairing of  Robert-Jan Derksen  and  Joost Luiten  (68).  Like Ireland, South Africa also had a pair of major winners who faltered on the final day, with  Charl Schwartzel  and  Louis Oosthuizen  only able to record a 74 to quickly drop out of contention.  Defending champions Italy, represented by  Edoardo Molinari  and  Francesco Molinari , also had a final-round 74 to finish 17th, 10 shots back.   Copyright 2011 by The Associated Press
