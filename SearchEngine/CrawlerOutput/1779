	 “Balance, core strength and flexibility are key points to the golf swing. I had heard about EFX and then I noticed it on some of the USA team members at the Ryder Cup last year.  I couldn't believe the results experienced. I wear mine every round.”

       “I have been wearing the EFX wristband for a year now and I just came off my best year ever on tour! I have noticed a difference in the way I feel and play, I'm not sure how exactly it works, but it does! I don't feel comfortable playing golf without it!”
