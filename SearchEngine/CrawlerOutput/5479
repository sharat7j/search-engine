	 Dear diary 
	
	  Science Shack takes on the Millennium Bridge, aided by a Vauxhall Astra and some olive oil. Their  diary  will take you behind the scenes, warts and all.  

	
	 Mystery solved 
	
	  It cost 18 million pounds, but when it opened the Millennium Bridge wobbled. Engineers were mystified: the explanation was about more than just science. Uncover the  explanation  for the Millennium Bridge wobble.  








    
   







 
 







 	 





	  Adam Hart-Davis and the team investigate the cause of the Millenium Bridge wobble, as part of the BBC/OU's Science Shack series.  




	 When the new footbridge over the Thames opened, we all flocked to have a go. Unfortunately, human traffic set up vibrations in the bridge that forced its closure. Could it be fixed and what exactly was the problem?  Adam and his team investigate what went wrong. Wobbling bridges aren't new, so why did this one produce huge shock waves among the engineers? Were our walking patterns to blame? What would have happened if cars not people crossed the bridge?   Follow the investiagtion in their  Diary , or learn more about the  science  involved.
