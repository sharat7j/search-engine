					  Oates Goes Back-to-Back at the 2011 Summit County Amateur; Wins the Event for the Fifth Time  

					 by Allen Freeman  |  August 7, 2011    No Comments  

					 

  Crewse makes his tournament-tying effort on the final hole at the 2011 Summit County Am.  
 Defending champion Dave Oates started the second round of the 2011 Summit County Amateur Golf Championship making bogey, then double-bogey. 
 Yup, three over par after the first two holes. Chili-choppin’ hacker stuff. Two shots back at the start of the day, now five shots back after just two holes. 
 It didn’t matter. 
  
 Oates rallied with four birdies on that same nine (the back nine at Good Park, where all the leaders start) and finished the day with a 2-under par score of 69 and a 1-under par 141 total to win his second consecutive Summit County Amateur title — amazingly, his fifth career win in the event. 
 But it’s not like Oates won going away, and that the day didn’t have it’s drama. Because it did, especially coming down to the final few holes.

					  Mastran Aces a Par 4 at the Summit County Am — But Doesn’t Get a Skin!  

					 by Allen Freeman  |  August 6, 2011    No Comments  

					 

 Michael Mastran made what might be the shot of his life in Saturday’s first round of the 2011 Summit County Amateur at Good Park Golf Course in Akron.  
 With the tees moved up to 270 yards to entice players into going for the par-4 green at the 12th hole, Mastran flew his tee shot with a driver directly at the tucked front-left ‘sliver’ position and landed his ball right behind the hole. The ball bounced up, and from the tee the group thought the ball flown over the very small corner of the green.   [Read more ?]

					  Crewse Bomb Seals Summit County Am Victory  

					 by Allen Freeman  |  August 2, 2009    No Comments  

					 

 With Anthony Yacovazzi about 15 feet closer and looking for his third birdie in five holes, and with the lead down to just two shots, Aaron Crewse of Uniontown could have felt a little pressure. His 5-wood to the 219-yard par-3 tournament finishing hole at Good Park was off the front of the green, and he was staring at an uphill 48-foot putt to try to hang on to the 2009 Summit County Amateur Championship. 
 But using the same “sight it and hit it” tempo that had served Crewse well for 35 holes, he read the putt, stepped up and calmly rapped it up the slope and into the hole, much to the delight of the crowd that filled Good Park’s “stands”. 
 The unlikely “downtown” birdie at the finish allowed Crewse to close the day at 2-under par 69, good for a 5-under par total of 137, a three shot victory and his first Summit County Am win. But to Crewse, the final putt was not the key to victory. 
 “The key to the round for me was the up-and-downs I made for par on my first nine,” said the 37-year old Crewse. “I made a par save on my first hole from about 12 feet, another good save on my second hole from about 6 feet, and a big up and down from about 20 feet on my seventh hole on the front nine. Those saves kept the feeling going for me, which helped me focus on what I was doing instead of worry about anyone else.”

					  Aaron Crewse Jumps Out to First Round Lead at 2009 Summit County Am  

					 by Allen Freeman  |  August 1, 2009    No Comments  

					 

 Aaron Crewse of Cuyahoga Falls grabbed the first round lead of the 2009 Summit County Amateur Golf Championship at Good Park Golf Course on Saturday, posting a roller-coaster 3-under par 68 to lead by two shots going into Sunday’s finish. 
 Crewse birdied his first two holes of the day and his last two holes of the day, and in between made two more birdies, a bogey and a double-bogey on the tenth. Regardless, it was enough positive scores to earn a two shot lead over Anthony Yacovazzi. 
 25 players posted rounds of 74 or better, so given the wet conditions and expected wind tomorrow, the finale should be a barn-burner. 
  Plain Dealer recap here ;  Akron Beacon Journal story here . 
Complete field scores from all 174 players in Saturday’s round are posted below. Groupings and Starting Times for Sunday’s final round will be posted by 8 p.m.
