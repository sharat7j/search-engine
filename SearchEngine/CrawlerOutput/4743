 ODP Data Dumps 

 General Description 
 The  Open Directory Project  distributes
its data in an  RDF -like 
 XML  format. These data files are 
generated on a regular basis and may be downloaded from  this
directory . 

 Errata 
 Unfortunately, the data dump format used by the Open Directory Project is
not optimal. In particular it is much longer than it needs to be, and is not
in standard RDF format. 
 Because of this, the format will need to change from time to time. We will
note the changes in this file until we have a better method for notifying
users of the changes. 

 Changes 


 2010-02-25 
 There has been a decision in the release of DMOZ 2.0 that we would
go back and use the DMOZ 1.0 ontology.  This means that we will no longer deliver
the 2.0 ontology folder and there will be the single delivery.
Always watch this file should the editors decide to have new ontology some time
in the future.  For the timebeing, this is the files as delivered.
 

 2009-11-18 
 There was some confusion in the 1.0 RDF caused by the new Ontology used
in DMOZ 2.0.  This caused two Top categories to be present in the structure.rdf.u8
file.  The first one should have been "Top/World" which had children of all the
languages.  This has been corrected and World/English has been removed.
 
There is also a change to the 2.0 RDF where all of the isocodes have been replaced
with the languages used by DMOZ.  This is a preferable solution allowing us the 
flexibility to change how we use codes without disturbing the output.  It also
makes it easier on the users of the data, not to have to decipher the code.
 
A further reminder to the fact that if you want Kids_and_Teens or Adult content
you need to specifically pick up the files that are prefixed with kt- or ad-.  This
content is not bundled in the structure or content files.
 

 2009-09-25 
 There is a slight change to the RDF in regards to how multiple
Kids_and_Teens parameters are used.  In the past these were '/' separated values
such as <ages>kids/mteens</ages>.  These will now be rendered each within an
<ages> tag.  It will appear as <ages>kids</ages> and <ages>mteens</ages>.
 

 2009-09-04
 
The RDF now contains the tags.html which displays the tags that are included in the files.
The attempt is to support all the previous tags with a few changes.
The explaination below refers to any of the ad- kt- aol- or general files.  These
are all produced in the same fashion.

Structure.rdf.u8
<D:charset> is no longer requires since all encoding is utf8 throughout.
<dispname> may not make it in this migration so may not yet be present.
<newsGroup> has been changed to "newsgroup" for consistancy

Content.rdf.u8
<Link1> added in this rdf error by omission
<mediadate> added in this rdf error by omission
<type> added in this rdf error by omission
<ages> added in this rdf error by omission
<atom> added in this rdf error by omission
<atomi1> added in this rdf error by omission
<pdf> added in this rdf error by omission
<pdf1> added in this rdf error by omission
<rss> added in this rdf error by omission
<rss1> added in this rdf error by omission
<ages> added in this rdf error by omission
<uksite> this tag has been added with a value of 1 if it is a uksite

As you will see, the Adult content has a separate delivery from the other content delivery in
a similar way to the method of the Kids_and_Teens.  
There are many changes to the RDF with the new DMOZ_2.0 in the wings. We
apologize for any inconvenience to you but it will get better.   The most major
change is that the Ontology differs in regards to how languages are handled.
In the past there was inconsistency between the top categories, with languages under
Top/World/Espa–ol and Kids_and_Teens/International/Espa–ol/ and Adult/World/Deutsch/.
These have now been changed to the following top categories /Top/es, /Kids_and_Teens/es,
and /Adult/de.   This gives a more consistant result overall and brings the language
content more forward.  
We are delivering two sets of RDF files. The old files are currently in the normal RDF location and
inside that is a folder dmoz_2.0 which contains the new files.   We prefer that you
use the new files within dmoz_2.0 since these will be the files used going forward
and with the launch of 2.0 the old RDF will be sunsetted.   You will also note that
the file names and content are reordered in both the old and new. 
There is the following files containing content  
ad-content.rdf.u8 
ad-rss.rdf.u8 
ad-structure.rdf.u8 
ad-terms.rdf.u8 
aol-content.rdf.u8 
aol-rss.rdf.u8 
aol-structure.rdf.u8 
aol-terms.rdf.u8 
kt-content.rdf.u8 
kt-rss.rdf.u8 
kt-structure.rdf.u8 
kt-terms.rdf.u8 
content.rdf.u8 
rss.rdf.u8 
structure.rdf.u8 
terms.rdf.u8 

 
The Adult content is under ad-structure, terms, rss and content. 

 2004-04-26 
 In addition to link tags, we now have pdf,
rss, and atom tags for non-html content. All RSS/Atom feeds
are validated before we add them to the directory. In the next few weeks,
you'll see a separate rss.rdf.u8.gz file that will contain only categories
and rss/atom feeds.
 

 2003-05-29 
 ExternalPage objects now contain a topic tag that reflects 
the category this listing belongs in.
 

 2003-05-20 
 A few new tags have been to the RDF files. There is a tag 
dispname which gives the "display name" for each category. In addition, 
several new aol-specific tags have been added: aolsearch , 
aolshopping , aolkeyword , aoltopictype , and 
aolcattype .
 

 2003-03-12 
 More error-checking and filtering on the editor data entry forms
have been added to prevent UTF-8 and XML character encoding problems. The data
dumps should now contain no illegal UTF-8 byte sequences, no illegal XML
characters, and only well-formed XML. Each data dump is now tested for
errors. The  error report  contains
specific results for each of these three types of errors. 

 2002-07-23 
 
Data in the Netscape/ tree is no longer included in the main RDF dump. Instead,
it is provided in these files: 
 
 netscape-content.rdf.u8.gz 
 netscape-structure.rdf.u8.gz 
 netscape-terms.rdf.u8.gz 
 

 2000-11-20 
 
A few additions have been made to the RDF files. There is a tag for altlang
categories which behaves exactly like the symbolic tags. Tags have also been
added for mediadate and ages (for Kids_and_Teens) with regards to URLs if these
qualities exist for each URL.

 The RDF files are going UTF-8. I hope that this will clear up a
lot of the problems that some users have been having with the format.  If you
notice any problems, please send mail to truel@dmoz.org. 
 We will continue to generate the current RDF files until at 
least January 8, 2000.  We will be generating UTF-8 files periodically until
that date.  After January 9, all rdf files will be in the UTF-8 character set. 
 N.B. Some languages may have some incorrect characters. More
precisely some of our categories do not have a character set 
associated with them yet, and so I am converting them to UTF-8 as though they
were encoded in ISO-8859-1.  Please do not send me email if you think
you know what character set a given language should be in, but only if
you know what character set the given ODP category is in.

 I have created an eGroups.com mailing list to announce changes
to the rdf format.  To sign up, fill your email address in the following form:

 Now provide  redirect.rdf.u8.gz  which
lists categories which have been moved and where they have been moved to. This
should obviate your need for the  catmv.log.gz  file. 
 Redirections here are pre-chained. That is if a category has 
moved many places, the redirection listed is the first one that actually hits
a category.  If someone moves a directory around and someone else
creates a directory at one of the intermediate locations, the newcomer is the
redirection listed. 

 1999-07-29 
 Character escaping is being done inside all fields now, not 
just in Titles and Descriptions. The following four characters are being 
quoted, so you will have to unquote them when converting to html: 
 
  &  &amp;  
  <  &lt;  
  >  &gt;  
  "  &quot;  
 
 High byte characters and non-printing control characters are
also being quoted now.  I have decided against utilizing actual character
quoting (ie. &#21ae;) since supporting full unicode is beyond the
capabilities of some of our customers.  Instead the hex value of the these
characters will be presented, and if you wish to convert to unicode, you will
have to keep track of the charset for the given category. 
 As an expamle, the byte value of 200 will be presented as
&xC8; whether that character was from the 8859-1 character set 
(&#C8; or é or &#C8;) or from 8859-2 (? or &#x010C;)
or from any other character set. 

 1999-05-18 
 
Symbolic links that have been separated from the rest of the subcategories
now have the link type "<symbolic1 ...>". This is exactly analogous
to "<narrow1 ...>" (for separated subcategories).
