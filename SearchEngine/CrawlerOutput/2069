  CHAMPIONSHIP 2012   
Inverness 9th Green 
Inverness Golf Club is hosting the 81st Annual CWDGA Championship Tournament, which will be held Monday through Wednesday, August 6-8.  
Established as a retreat for employees of the Cudahy Packing Company in the 20?s, Inverness is steeped in tradition. The Inverness golf course has challenged golfers for decades with its rolling terrain and slippery greens while maintaining its classic feel.   
In recent years, Inverness has hosted prestigious qualifiers for the U.S. Senior Open in 2010 and Illinois Open Championship in 2011.  For 2012, Inverness is hosting both the U.S. Open Local Qualifier and the Illinois Open Qualifier.  And the CWDGA Championship as well.  This will be a challenging and rewarding experience for our competitors.   TOURNAMENTS FOR 2012
