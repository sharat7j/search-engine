         Health Communication and  Training 
         The Oak  Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) collaborates with federal,  state and local agencies to provide health communication and technical training programs to benefit   industry professionals and the public. 
         
         ORISE works closely with  these agencies to prepare for and  address public health challenges resulting from pandemics (such as H1N1 influenza virus), large-scale disasters,  terrorism and  other national and international emergencies. We specifically focus our efforts on health communication planning, international  and community workshops, media monitoring and social media messaging.  
          ORISE also specializes in audience- and multimedia-based approaches to health communication. These methods broaden the scope and reach of   messages that address public health challenges, such as the spread of infectious diseases, chronic diseases,  and other health threats.

            ORISE Develops Mapping Application for CDC's CHEMPACK Program  
           ORISE designed and built a mapping application that  helps  CHEMPACK’s staff and their state and local partners keep track of the antidote  cache sites and containers. 
 
            
            The Virtual Community Reception Center  
           Following a mass  casualty radiation emergency, public health professionals  engage in population monitoring that is often conducted in  community reception centers, or CRCs, but unfortunately, many public health  departments are not yet prepared to conduct CRC operations.
