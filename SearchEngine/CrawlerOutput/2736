           Science Education Programs 
           The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and more than  a dozen other federal agencies rely on the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) to help meet future needs in critical science and technology  areas through the recruitment and training of our nation’s next generation of scientists and engineers.  
           
           To meet these pressing demands, ORISE assesses current science and technology labor needs and  then designs  and implements programs that meet the unique goals of each agency. Research participants are  recruited nationally, including special outreach to Historically  Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority-Serving  Education Institutions.  
            ORISE matches these participants  with research opportunities at national research facilities and administers the appointments. Completing the process, ORISE provides follow-up analysis and  evaluation of the  programs.  
           A highly qualified and diverse group of students and faculty are recruited for ORISE science education programs. As a result, ORISE  continues to maintain very high placement rates for both women and  underrepresented minorities.
