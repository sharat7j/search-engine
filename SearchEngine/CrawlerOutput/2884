 New! 
 
 
 GSA's mentor programs at Annual and Section meetings have been a real success story for students. We are pleased to build upon these well-attended and career-enhancing opportunities through a new partnership with MentorNet. 
 
 
    
 
 
 MentorNet pairs college students in the sciences with professionals who serve as e-mentors to help answer questions throughout the year.  
 
 
  To participate,

 Mentor Programs 

 GSA currently runs five programs devoted to the ideals of mentorship: 
 
  Geology in Government  
  Geology in Industry  
  John Mann Mentors in Applied Hydrogeology  
  Roy J. Shlemon Mentors in Applied Geology  
  Women in Geology  
 
 These programs are all designed to facilitate mentoring relationships between professionals in the field of applied geology and university students.  
 If you are a student seeking career advice, you will find it here. If you are a professional, become a mentor! Wherever you are in your career, there will always be someone with less experience than you who can benefit from your advice. Read more about these programs and get involved! Your experience and advice are invaluable to a student contemplating his or her future.  
 If you would like to learn more about becoming a mentor or have questions about these programs, please contact Jennifer Nocerino,   .

(maximum six e-mails per year).
