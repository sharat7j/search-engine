     The  Pebble Beach Links  on the Monterey Peninsula in Northern California is widely regarded as one of the  most beautiful courses in the world. It hugs the rugged coastline and has wide  open views of the ocean. The course was designed by Jack Neville and  Douglas Grant and opened on February 22, 1919. Neville also designed the  back nine at Pacific Grove Municipal Golf Course on the other side of the  MontereyPeninsula. His objective was, of course, to place as many of the holes  as possible along the rocky and beautiful Monterey coast line. This was  accomplished using a "figure 8" layout.  In laying out the course, Jack Neville  attempted to bring as many holes to the rocky coastline as possible. The first  two holes are inland, the third runs toward the ocean, and the fourth and fifth  holes run along the coast. This arrangement allowed Neville to make use of a  peninsula which juts straight out into the Pacific Ocean. The lower "loop" of the figure 8 layout is formed  by holes 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, which brings much of the inward nine inland.  Unlike virtually all modern courses, Pebble's 9th and 10th holes do not  therefore return to the clubhouse. Holes 14 and 15 are among the most inland on  the course, but the 16th hole runs alongside the 3rd hole to complete the  figure 8 and bring the dramatic closing holes along the Pacific Coast. These  include the long par 3 17th, whose place in golf history was assured when Jack  Nicklaus (1972) and Tom Watson (1982) made key shots there to win U.S. Opens...

     Spyglass Hill  Golf Club 
     The  Spyglass Hill golf course  on the Monterey Peninsula of California was designed by Robert Trent  Jones, Sr., and opened on March 11, 1966, after six years of planning, design,  and construction. The course has been in the rotation for the AT&T Pebble  Beach National Pro-Am, a February tournament on the West Coast Swing of the PGA  Tour, since 1967. It plays at 6,953 yards to a par of 72 from the championship  (blue) tees, with a course rating of 75.5 and a slope rating of 147. The first  five holes all have views of the Pacific Ocean, and the other thirteen wind  through the Del Monte Forest. Originally called Pebble Beach Pines Golf Club,  the course was renamed to Spyglass Hill by Samuel F. B. Morse, the founder of  Pebble Beach Company, after the place in Treasure Island, since his friend  Robert Louis Stevenson had taken inspiration for his novel from the local  area. All the holes at Spyglass Hill were later also named after characters  and places from Treasure Island. The first hole is called Treasure Island,  and is a downhill 595 yard par 5, which doglegs almost 90 degrees to the left.  One of the more renowned holes is the fourth, a 370 yard par 4 named Blind Pew,  which Robert Trent Jones has called his favorite par 4. The green is the most  photographed on the course, and is surrounded by ice plants. Other hole names  include The Black Spot (3rd), Captain Flint (10th), and Long John Silver (14th).( Article sourced Here - Wikipedia.com ) CaddyBytes image Par 3- 3rd Hole Spyglass Hill G.C. - ( Click Here to See our Slide Show ):
