 Nobody
  has journeyed to the center of the Earth to see what it is like. However, scientists
  using seismic waves have developed models showing what the Earth is made of
  and the thickness of the different layers.

     Crust 
      The crust is the Earth’s thin outer rind. It accounts for only 0.4
    percent of the Earth's mass. The boundary between the crust and the mantle
    is called the Mohorovicic Discontinuity or MOHO for short.  
    There are two types of crust:  
    1.) The continental crust is 30-70 kilometers thick. It is made of all three
    types of rocks;  igneous ,  sedimentary , and  metamorphic . Most of these rocks
    are made of 60 to 70 percent silica (or quartz). 
     
    2.) The oceanic crust is only six kilometers thick. It is composed of layers
    of igneous rocks that contain 50 to 60 percent silica. These rocks have more
    iron and magnesium than those in the continental crust. Magma that erupts
    onto the ocean floor cools quickly, forming pillow lava. Over thousands of
    years, the remains of shells and microscopic plants and animals rain down,
  blanketing the deep ocean floor under a layer of sediment.

   Upper
    Mantle 
    The upper mantle is 400 kilometers thick. It is weaker than the rest of the
    mantle and bends and flows under pressure. Like the lower mantle, the upper
  mantle is made up of minerals rich in iron, silica, magnesium, and oxygen.  Back to introduction »   
 
   Lower
    Mantle 
    The solid lower mantle is 2,500 kilometers thick. It is composed of minerals
    rich in iron, silica, magnesium, and oxygen. Together, the upper and lower
  mantle make up two-thirds of the Earth's mass.   Back to introduction »   
   
   Outer
    Core 
    The liquid outer core is about 2,300 kilometers thick. It contains molten
  iron and nickel.   Back to introduction »   
   
   Inner
    Core 
    The solid inner core extends about 1,200 kilometers from the center of the
  Earth. It is mostly made of solid iron and nickel.   Back to introduction »
