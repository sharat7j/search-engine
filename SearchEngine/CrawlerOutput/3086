 NEW RESOURCE TO EMBED RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE  CURRICULUM 
  www.solar-active.com/guide.pdf  
 The SOLAR-ACTIVE solar cars/boats used  in the  Engineering A Better World  Solar Detectives  Case Study  are  recommended by   QCDA  on the National Currculum KS3/4 home page. The  Inspired Engineering Curriculum Case Study  states that in using these resources and educational method pupils have been helped to transfer knowledge and skills between different subject areas – providing the opportunity for x-currcular schemes for work. 
 Visit  www.solar-active.com/store  for information on resources [i.e. solar car/boat, lorry, mini-water pump, hydro-foil and clock] – using our unique flexible solar cell that has significant output under diffuse light conditions. 
  Minsthorpe  Community College used the resources to make learning and teaching enjoyable, foster enthusiasm and raise attainment in developing problem solving skills in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. 
 
 Is our future Nuclear Free or Nuclear? – Debate was a success with some 80 people attending.   The audio of the debate  is here:  http://sheffield.indymedia.org.uk/2010/04/449994.htm
