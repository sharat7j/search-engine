		 Popularity Contest 
	 
	 
		 Popularity Contest is a  WordPress  plugin that keeps track of activity on your blog and calculates a popularity percentage for each post and page. 
 The popularity display you see: 
  Popularity: 27% [ ? ]  
 is the rank of that post or page compared to the other posts and pages on the site. 
 Since page view counts, etc. are cumulative, newer posts will generally have lower popularity values than older posts. This, of course, evens out over time. 
 The values for different events (page views, feed views, comments, etc.) are configurable on a per-site basis, so each site may rank their content differently. 
 The Popularity Contest plugin is available on my  WordPress Plugins  page.

				 Hi Alex, 
 I just want to thank you very much for this plug-in and for share-it. Both are great …  
 I found this from the new [?] link and I have a small suggestion. I think this page should be more visible … a little better structured. 
 All the best and Merry Christmas!

				 Alex, Thanks for all your dedication, re: developing these excellent plugins. 
They really do reinforce my occassional thought that maybe hosting your own blogs is better than using standard blogging engines. Clearly, if one has the time then a more valued set of interactive tools can help us humble bloggers!

				 This is a really nice piece of software. Thank you for writing it! 
 Please allow me to suggest a feature I missed. It would be really nice to be able to configure a window size (of say 2 weeks). When calculationg percentages and counts, the plugin should only take the hits in that time window into account. This way we can have a better idea of what is really popular now, instead of what has been popular the whole time.

				 Wow!  I noticed this on a blog I was visiting earlier today (wish I remembered where) and thought it was a grand idea.  I assumed it would be difficult to implement, especially as I’m really new to WordPress.  But it was easier than pie, and for that I must thank you! 
 Excellent job!

				 Hi Alex, 
I think there IMHO is one problem with the popularity check in contrast to a simple view count: new posts seem most unpopular when compared to older posts that naturally have more views on their side. You may want to consider adding a malus/bonus system: the older a post, the bigger the malus it gets. So, if there are no new page hits on that post, the popularity goes down. 
regards, Mario

				 I’ve just installed it on my blog. I made a few changes to the code to fit in better with the sidebar I have on my site. Basically added the popularity of each post onto the end of the post name. 
 This plugin is awesome. I have only one complaint, that it doesn’t handle comments being deleted or marked as spam. If it could recognise these events it would be awesome. 
 I understand from comments above that it is the fault of WordPress rather than this plugin. 
Thanks very much for the work you’ve put into this plugin.

				 Great plugin, thanks. 
 One comment though: when a site gets dugg, or somehow one single post gets a lot of hits, suddenly all other posts get diminished. 
 On my blog I had one post once featured prominently on diggit, and now all my other posts are way below the 20% mark, which is kind of a sad marking. Is there a way to change the scale of the percentage rating, i.e. make it logarithmic?

				 If Google claims “content is king,” they’re a bunch of hypocrites selling their principles for profit, and trashing the Internet in the process.  Every time I surf the Web looking for information on ‘whatever’ I have to wade through dozens of trash websites that exist for no other reason than to display Google’s ads. 
 Google’s “PageRank” ratings are largely a farce, too.  Everyone wants that coveted PageRank number so bad most content that should be focused on the visitor is more focused on working in those precious keywords Google values so much. Content doesn’t just take a back seat to keywords, it’s in the back row. 
 I don’t object to Google playing middleman for advertising, but I do think they should be more selective about where the put their ads.  If I understand correctly (I refuse to use Google ads), they don’t allow their ads to be placed on any type of adult-oriented websites, but total time-wasting trash websites are welcome.

				 Great plugin, I love its algorithm that uses different types of visits to build rank points   
 I have an issue. I’ve been being spammed/flooded by harvesters and some strange kind of persistent visits over specific posts, making them rank higher. 
 With Counterize I’m able to find these visits, list them and delete them, and when I delete a hit log it is automatically subtracted on page count, referer count, browser count, etc, all at once. 
 But with Popularity I’m not able to do that. These pages are getting artificially high ranked, and the only solution I found was go to database and edit its values directly, rounding to a not specific value. 
 Do you know of a better way of removing these junk visits from statistic?

				 Yes, Iâ€™ve included it and it was very easy. Iâ€™ve put it on a my testblog and it works fine. The only thing is that itâ€™d be nice if there is any way you donâ€™t include the invisible traffic at the stats.
