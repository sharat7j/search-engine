     Relations  
      
    
    Definition 
    A relation is any set of ordered pairs. 
    
    Domain 
    The domain is the set of all first elements.  These "first elements" are referred to as the independent variable, or X.
    example: (0,0), (8,9), (5,5), (4,2)
    The domain of the set is {0, 4, 5, 8} 
    
    Range 
    The range is the set of all second elements.  These "second elements" are referred to as the dependent variable, or Y.
    example: (0,0), (8,9), (5,5), (4,2)
    The range of the set is {0, 2, 5, 9} 
    
    Visual Display 
    The data in the set can be displayed visually.  The two types of visual presentations are mapping diagrams (left) and graphs (right).
    example: (0,0), (8,9), (5,5), (4,2)
