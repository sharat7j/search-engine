            Ice Ages  
             Today,
              icebergs and sea ice are found in the world's coldest oceans of
              the Antarctic and Arctic, and glaciers are found at the tops of
              the highest mountains. But ice on the continents and around the
              polar seas has grown and retreated many times in the last few million
              years.  Start interactive  »

                      vertical: Gauging ocean overturn rates  
Water in the ocean has different ages at different depths. Scientists can determine
these ages, and find out how long water takes to circulate through the entire
ocean and then come back to the surface.  Learn

             Dating
                      corals, knowing the ocean  
  Coral skeletons record the age of the coral, as well as the age of the water
  in which they grow. Using radioactive decay dating techniques on fossil, scientists
  can tease this information apart.  Learn
