                     Monday’s Three Stars: Quick blanks Sharks; Ryder gets two

 Perhaps a touch arrogant after his fourth shutout of the year,  Jonathan Quick  (notes)  knights himself. 
 No. 1 Star: Jonathan Quick,  Los Angeles Kings  
 Quick made 33 saves for his league-leading fourth shutout of the season, helping the Kings overcome their scoring woes by making damn sure it didn't matter.  Ethan Moreau  (notes)  scored the game winner 8:32 into the first period and  Mike Richards  (notes)  added an insurance marker in the second as the Kings beat the  San Jose Sharks   2-0 . 
 No. 2 Star:  Michael Ryder  (notes) ,  Dallas Stars  
 Ryder scored the game-winner and the empty-netter to ice the game as the Dallas Stars skated out of Colorado with a  3-1  win over the Avalanche.  Andrew Raycroft  (notes)  was fantastic, stopping 35 of 36 shots, and  Eric Nystrom  (notes)  added his 8th of the season. Hey, remember when Minnesota gave him away for free? 
 No. 3 Star:  Nicklas Backstrom  (notes) ,  Minnesota Wild  
 Speaking of Minnesota, Backstrom made 32 stops as the Wild held on to top the  Tampa Bay Lightning  3-1 and stop their losing skid at two straight.  Mikko Koivu  (notes)  and  Cal Clutterbuck  (notes)  added a goal and an assist apiece, collaborating on both a shorthanded and an empty net goal. 
 Honourable mention:  Nick Spaling  (notes)  scored the game-winner midway through the third period as the  Nashville Predators  edged the  Edmonton Oilers   2-1 ... 
 Did you know? After their game,  the Oilers announced  that  Taylor Hall  (notes)  will miss 2-4 weeks with shoulder surgery. 
 Dishonourable mention:  Vincent Lecavalier  (notes)  finished a minus-3 versus the Wild and won only 6 of 19 faceoffs... Also,  Jordin Tootoo  (notes)  with the embellishment of the year:

                     Ickey Woods doesn’t like ‘Me-First’ aspect of touchdown dances  
                    By       Doug Farrar  /  Shutdown Corner   
                   
                  
                  
                   
                      It's a "me-first" league right now and for Ickey Woods, the over-the-top touchdown celebrations are a far cry from his spontaneous and joyful dances in the end zone. 
 The former  Cincinnati Bengals  running back developed the  "Ickey Shuffle,"  arguably the most famous touchdown celebration in NFL history. Woods became not only a fan favorite in Cincinnati during his career that lasted from 1988 to 1991, but he also was an icon for years to come across the league with his shuffle. His dance continues to stand the test of time and is the standard by which all other celebrations will be judged. 
 So when Woods sees something like what  Buffalo Bills  wide receiver  Stevie Johnson  (notes)  did on Sunday against the  New York Jets , he doesn't see it as in the same spirit as his celebrations two decades ago. After scoring a second quarter touchdown to give the Bills a 14-7 lead, Johnson  danced in the end zone  then mocked shooting himself in the thigh, a move clearly targeting the arrest of Jets wide receiver  Plaxico Burress  (notes) . Three years ago outside a New York City nightclub, Burress accidentally shot himself in the leg, was hospitalized and served two years in prison for the incident. 
 As if that wasn't enough, Johnson then flew around like a jet and mimicked a crash landing, drawing a penalty. The 15 yard call helped gift the Jets good field position and they tied the game up four plays later, ironically via a Burress touchdown. 
 "I actually really didn't know what he was doing at first but then seeing it on SportsCenter and them explaining it, I understood it," Woods told Yahoo! Sports. "A lot of the celebration now is self-motivated — it's about me - it's not to get the fans involved, it's unfortunate." 
 Woods said that when he developed his shuffle, there was no flack from his then head coach Sam Wyche as he realized that Woods was doing it out of joy and only after a touchdown. He never practiced it — "no need to since I created it" — and he only remembers being penalized for it once when he did it in the back of the end zone rather than along the sidelines. There was never anything malicious about his dance nor did it in any way target a player on the opposing sideline. 
 "Guys are doing a lot of self-promotion now with the celebration dance. When I did it, it was for the fans, I never did it away from home," Woods said. "A lot of the stuff now is motivated and that's what the league has come to. A lot of the guys from my era played for the love of the game. Now it's a 'me era,' it's a money thing now." 
 After the game, Johnson acknowledged that "most definitely it hurt our team" as his penalty in large part helped set the Jets up with the equalizing touchdown in such short order and on Monday, he called  to apologize to Burress . While in his postgame remarks Burress basically brushed aside the targeted jab from Johnson, on Monday afternoon, Jets cornerback  Darrelle Revis  (notes)  said he doesn't understand why the celebration played out like it did. Revis was on coverage of Johnson for that play and says that he should have been the target of the celebration, not his teammate. 
 "I felt it had nothing to do with the situation," Revis said. "If anything he scored on me so come at me if anything. That's just wrong to me, it wasn't smart on his part, doing the gun thing and shooting himself. To me, that was disrespectful to Plaxico in a way."

                     Brandon Dubinsky on Jody Shelley: ‘He’s a terrible hockey player’  
                    By       Harrison Mooney  /  Puck Daddy   
                   
                  
                  
                   
                         
 Here, for the second time today, is the teaser for HBO's much-anticipated 24/7 Flyers Rangers, which should serve to get you appropriately excited for program. It's worth a revisit, especially in light of the delicious back-and-f0rth it has spawned between  Jody Shelley  (notes)  and  Brandon Dubinsky  (notes) . 
 I direct your attention specifically to Shelley's standout moment at the six-minute mark, in which he says the following of the  New York Rangers ' centre: 
  Brandon Dubinsky plays like a little weasel. He's a guy you like to get at.  
 One assumes that Shelley isn't using weasel in a complimentary sense, as I've never known anyone to. It's a shame. The weasel's cleverness is admirable. 
 Anyway. It would appear that Brandon Dubinsky has taken offense to Shelley's scouting report, as he didn't exactly mince words when asked about the teaser after practice Monday afternoon. From the  NY Daily News : 
  "First of all, if I was him, I'd keep my mouth shut if I don't play, especially since I never see him on the ice," Dubinsky said of Shelley, who has played in only 10 of Philadelphia's 23 games this season. "He's usually just yapping from the bench, and I guess now he's yapping from behind the video camera. So that's about all I have to say."  
 It's a classic defense when a fourth liner lashes out at a star player. How would you know how I play? We're hardly on the ice together, which is weird, since I'm on the ice a lot. It's both an effective putdown and a humble brag. 
 But Dubinsky wasn't done there. Despite saying "That's about all I have to say," the media scrum wisely kept their recorders running, and he said something else. 
  "Jody Shelley - it won't be long before he's out of the league, because he's a terrible hockey player," he added.  
 Wow. You'd think a guy that plays for John Tortorella would be a little more tactful about things, you know? 
 I wasn't sure it was possible for my appetite for 24/7 Flyers Rangers to be anymore whetted, but oh man, this is juicy awesome. This show is going to rule. 
 One wonders how long these two have held such negative opinions of one another. Only two seasons ago, the two were teammates in New York.

                     Shanahan: Letang assumed risk, Max Pacioretty suspended 3 games  
                    By       Greg Wyshynski  /  Puck Daddy   
                   
                  
                  
                   
                    One of the hallmarks of the Brendan Shanahan-led NHL Department of Player Safety has been a shared responsibility between the player hitting and the player being hit. 
 The high hit administered by Montreal Canadiens forward Max Pacioretty on Saturday night that broke the nose of Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Kris Letang offered its share of challenges, from the principal of contact to Letang placing himself in harm's way. In the end, the NHL suspended Pacioretty for three games, and here's why: 
     
  From the NHL:  
  Montreal Canadiens forward Max Pacioretty has been suspended, without pay, for three games for delivering an illegal hit to the head of Pittsburgh defenseman Kris Letang during NHL Game #331 Saturday night in Montreal, the National Hockey League's Department of Player Safety announced today. 
 Under the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, and based on his average annual salary, Pacioretty will forfeit $26,351.34. The money goes to the Players' Emergency Assistance Fund. 
 The incident occurred at 16:46 of the third period. Letang suffered a broken nose as a result of the hit. No penalty was assessed on the play.  Pacioretty will miss games Nov. 30 at Anaheim, Dec. 1 at San Jose and Dec. 3 at Los Angeles. He will be eligible to return Dec. 6 vs. Columbus.  
 As for the hit, Shanahan made it clear: Letang knew what he was getting into but cutting down the middle of the ice, but that's not an invitation to skull-bash him.

                       Preview:  Tampa Bay Lighting at Minnesota Wild, 7:30 p.m. EST 
 Two of the NHL's most notorious trapping teams go head to head in a game that's sure to be one of the trippiest, trappiest affairs of the NHL season. The neutral zone will be anything but. That said, don't think this one won't be entertaining -- both teams are on the precipice of three-game streaks. The Lightning are riding high right now, having won two straight over the weekend, and the Wild are in the midst of their first rough patch of the season, having surrendered five goals in each of their last two games, both losses. Big game for both sides. 
  Preview:  Dallas Stars at Colorado Avalanche, 9:00 p.m. EST 
 As if things couldn't get any worse for the Stars, their current 2-6-1 streak has been compounded by the loss of Kari Lehtonen,  who will miss at least three weeks  with a groin injury. Andrew Raycroft gets the start for the Avalanche, which is a little concerning, since he's 0-7-0 in his last seven appearance with a 4.53 GAA. But that just means he's due. 
  Preview:  San Jose Sharks at Los Angeles Kings, 10:30 p.m. EST 
 Dale isn't the only Hunter having a good day. Trent Hunter gets his shot on the Kings' top line tonight, playing with Anze Kopitar and Dustin Brown. It's the long kind of shot, but the Kings have struggled to create offense all season and have only 7 goals in their last 4 games, so it definitely can't hurt to try. They'll have to be sure they don't open up in order to create chances, however. The Sharks are second in the league in shots, and their offense is clicking just fine.

                     This is Pato, Robinho and Thiago Silva singing on a train

 Milan's Facebook page shared this clip of Pato, Robinho and Thiago Silva grooving out to Michel Telo's " Ai Se Eu Te Pego " on train*. They really belt out the Brazilian singer/songwriter's hit, but they're far from the first to do the dance that goes with the tune. Real Madrid's  Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcelo , Arsenal's Andre Santos, Poland's Adrian Mierzejewski and Schalke's Lewis Holtby (among others) have all celebrated goals by doing the dance this season. And Neymar even appeared in the music video. 
 As enjoyable as their performance is, the most impressive part of the clip is the fact that Zlatan Ibrahimovic resists the urge to kick them all for a full 59 seconds. New record! 
 *The best part of the video, though, is Clarence Seedorf talking on an awesome red telephone behind them.

                    Well, lookie here. It's a meaningful game on a Monday night, featuring two quality teams. Someone at ESPN has made a terrible, terrible mistake.

 We'll be here throughout the game with running commentary, observations, insights, polls, blatant lies and a high level of interactivity with you, our beloved reader.

                     Deep Posts: Stevie Johnson has apologized to Plaxico Burress

 •  Plaxico Burress  (notes)  said on Monday that  Stevie Johnson apologized to him via text  and voicemail. That's nice to hear. Johnson's a 25-year-old guy. Did you make any jokes at the age of 25 that you'd be embarrassed of now? 
 • Colts: Awwwww,  look at Peyton Manning's baby . 
 • Colts II: There's a Colts fan out there who has  worn Colts gear every single day since fifth grade through 12th grade , where he is now. It's not a lifestyle choice that'd be for me, but I guess shopping for clothes only from NFLShop.com would be a life simplifier. 
 • Colts III: Bob Kravitz of IndyStar.com has not only penciled Andrew Luck in as a member of the  Indianapolis Colts  next year, but  he's also got him atop the depth chart at quarterback . Sorry, Peyton. 
 • The whole  Detroit Lions  organization is under scrutiny for how it's handled  Ndamukong Suh and his "dirty" ways . I'm not sure that's fair. Say Suh is dirty. Hell, say every member of the Detroit Lions team is a dirty player. That's still preferable to 20 years of not making the playoffs, right? That culture had to change, and it wasn't going to change with everyone giving each other backrubs at ice cream socials. 
 •  Roy Helu  (notes)  will  retain his position  as Redskins starting running back. 
 • Everyone seems to believe the Chargers will be firing Norv Turner at the end of the season.  Bolts from the Blue asks, "Why wait?"

                     Urban Meyer has landed at Ohio State, full speed ahead  
                    By       Matt Hinton  /  Dr. Saturday   
                   
                  
                  
                   
                            
 In narrative terms, the momentum of Michigan's 40-34 win over Ohio State was one-sided, to say the least. Here was Michigan, simultaneously vanquishing seven years' worth of angst against its most hated rival and  emerging from wilderness  under a new chief. Here was Denard Robinson, superstar, delivering the most transcendent performance of his career. It was an arrival at a far-off point in the distance. The day belonged to the Wolverines, and for the moment, so did the future. 
 For Ohio State, it was the inevitable end to a lost season — a lost year, really,  beginning last December  — that had predictably defied momentum at every turn. On the brink of collapse in October, the Buckeyes had rallied for three straight wins, two of them over 6-0 Illinois and 6-1 Wisconsin. On the brink of a stunning run at the Big Ten championship in November, they dropped their last three by a combined 15 points. They finished 6-6 overall and  a game behind Purdue  in the conference standings. 
   But the story is never quite that one-sided, even after abrupt reversal of seven thoroughly one-sided years. And somewhere in there, buried beneath the loss and the throngs of Maize 'n Blue swarming the field and the sheer exhaustion that accompanies the end of a three-month drama, there was one undeniable murmur of progress: Almost overnight, freshman Braxton Miller has grown from a wide-eyed athlete into a real, live Big Ten quarterback. 
 That was apparent on Saturday. Barely 48 hours later, Urban Meyer is  Ohio State's new head coach , and Miller is the engine of a new offense that will give him every opportunity to turn the murmur into a roar. 
 It was impossible to watch Miller in Ann Arbor and not marvel at both how far he's come since September, and how far he can go under the man who molded Tim Tebow and Alex Smith into prolific first-round draft picks. Meyer won a national championship with Chris Leak, for heaven's sake, with Troy Smith on the opposite sideline. None of them — even Tebow, a massively hyped but relatively little-used role player as an 18-year-old rhinoceros — were quite as good, quite as early, as Miller at the same point on their career trajectory. 
 In September, Miller was half of one of the most  hapless quarterback duos  ever assembled in losses to Miami and Michigan State, a young passer so overwhelmed by legitimate defenses that a 1-for-4, 17-yard afternoon in the win over Illinois was  a sign of progress .  A week later, he was  ad-libbing a Hail Mary  to beat the best team on the schedule.
