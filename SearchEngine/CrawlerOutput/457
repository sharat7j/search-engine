  Teachers interested in parcticipating in scientific research may contact the University of Rhode Island Office of Marine Programs, home to the ARMADA Project. The  ARMADA Project  is a mentoring and research experience program for K-12 teachers. It places teachers in research projects all over the world, including the polar regions.
