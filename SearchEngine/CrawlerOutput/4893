  Vaughan Wins Senior Open Championship After Playoff  
 By

 Bruce Vaughan and John Cook of the United States tied on six under par and went into a sudden death play-off at Royal Troon Golf Club in their bid to win the 2008 Senior Open Championship presented by MasterCard. 
 Vaughan prevailed on the first extra hole with a twenty foot birdie, Cook missed his birdie putt. 
 Vaughan had a mixed fourth round with early birdies at the 1st and 4th holes offset by bogeys on the 12th and 14th a third birdie came on the 16th, he completed the final 2 holes for par one under for the round. 
 Like Vaughan, Cook had a mixed round four birdies on the front nine and he looked like he was coasting to victory, unfortunately double bogey on the 11th and bogey on the 12th cut his lead to just one stroke, a further bogey on the last hole pegged him back to 6 under par and into the playoff with Vaughan. 
 Eduardo Romero of Argentina finished up in third place 1 stroke behind the leaders. 
 Pre-tournament favourite Bernhard Langer captured fourth place he shot 3 under par in his final round to finish up on -4. 
 Tom Watson, Greg Norman and Gene Jones tied for 5th place on 2 under par, Norman started like an express train with 5 birdies in the first 7 holes, he would have finished higher up the leaderboad but for a double bogey on the par 3 17th.
