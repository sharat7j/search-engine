This work was inspired by:
 
"Hyperactive Molecules", by Henry Rzepa and Ben Whitaker.
 
"Chemistry in the Market Place", by Ben Selinger, so good my
first three copies were 'borrowed',
 
 5th edition Harcourt Brace & Co, Australia, 1998.
 
"Molecules", by Peter Atkins, Scientific American Library, NY,
1987. Unfortunately, now 'borrowed' as well.
