								Lourdes Hospital - Consistent streamline approach to clinical activities   Amber Kelly-Harned is the Clinical Coordinator at Lourdes Hospital and has been using Sentri7 since April 2009. In this interview, she says Sentri7's ability to customize reports justified the hiring of a FTE for their pharmacy staff.
