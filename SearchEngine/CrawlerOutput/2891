I  had finished my degree course at University and after three years of  studying and graduating with a first class degree in Engineering I set  about applying for a job. I thought it would be easy to get the job I  was looking for after obtaining such a good degree, so I wasn't too  disappointed when my applications for the first few jobs were turned  down.

						Hamburg Hotel Venue for Tele-Mentoring Seminar			 
	
	
	
		 
 
 




 
 
Everyone  is really excited about the new seminar, as so much had taken place  since the last one almost 18 months ago. It is a great opportunity to  have a little break as well, and Hamburg seems like a fantastic city to  visit. So much is changing in the tele-mentoring world and it is up to  us as teachers to keep up to date with all of these ideological and  technological developments. Our teaching organisation was developed in  order to offer educational support and resources to variety of people,  mainly through the use of Internet communication technologies.  This  tele-mentoring seminar was going to be important, as I knew that there  was a lot of new developments that I needed to be educated on myself. I  think this was part of the reason that so many teachers enjoyed these  seminars so much, as they allow the teacher to turn into a student for a  couple of days.

I  was asked by my company if I would like to attend a course in Paris,  the courses content of tele-marketing was pretty much irrelevant to me,  for as soon as they had mentioned the location of the course my mind was  made up, I was definitely going. I travelled with other colleagues who  worked in the same building as me, but came from different sectors. Our  journey was good, we travelled via Eurostar on the way there and planned  to travel first class by plane on the way back. Love  On our  arrival there was a taxi waiting to take us to the hotel. We were taken  to a hotel which overlooked the Tuileres Gardens and the Eifel tower  could be seen clearly in the distance from the hotel balcony and the  hotels dining room. The hotel was in a real romantic setting, it was  unfortunate that I was on a trip with work.   The next morning we  arrived at the tele-marketing conference, it was set out as eight large  tables, our table was near the front where the mentor would be standing  to speak in the conference. At 10am the mentor walked in, my stomach  filled with butterflies and my heart was racing, the mentor was my first  love, Paul. I had not seen him since I was 15 and at school.
