					The good news is: Science in School continues to be funded by EIROforum with enough money to cover the online production. 
				 
					We are also making every effort to continue delivering your favourite science teaching journal as a print copy, for you to read on the train, refer to again and again, or share with colleagues, students and friends – but we need your help. 
				 
					We have decided not to charge subscription fees, but this will only work with your support. Donate today and make your contribution to better science education across Europe. Every cent we receive will be used towards the journal’s printing and distribution costs. 
				 
					It’s easy: all you need is a free  Paypal  account. This is a simple and secure way of transferring money online, and very useful, e.g. for online shopping. 
			 
			 
				 
		 
	 
 
 
	Please also tell your friends and colleagues, and help us rescue the print journal – for you! 
 
	 
		       
 
 
	Science in School is based at the  European Molecular Biology Laboratory .
