 Privacy Policy   
 Please read our Privacy Policy carefully to be sure you understand how we collect and use information and under what circumstances we share information about you.  
 WE CAN MODIFY THIS PRIVACY POLICY  
 We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, add or delete provisions of this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time, and we will post a notice and the effective date of any change on our Website. If you have given us your email address to use or we have some other means of contacting you, we may also do so in any or all of those ways, but our posting is the only official and required notice you will receive. Your use of our Website after the effective date of any such modification, means you accept and agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy, as modified. We urge you to come back to this web page and review this Privacy Policy regularly so that you remain aware of the terms and conditions that apply to you.  
 COLLECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION  
 "Personal Information" means any information obtained through your use of our Website which might reasonably be used to specifically identify you and may include your name, title, company, address, email and phone number, among other things. If and when we collect Personal Information from you, we do so on a voluntary basis. 
 We do not sell or rent your Personal Information to others. If necessary, our Website may collect payment and payment instrument information from you for the purpose of billing you for products and services you purchase through our Website. Bear in mind, as noted in the section below entitled Advertisers, Sponsors and Links to Others , if you leave our Website whether by clicking or selecting an advertisement, re-directing your browser or otherwise, their terms and conditions, privacy and other policies and practices will apply, not ours.  
 COLLECTING NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION  
 When you use our Website, we often use third party operational service providers and technology that can recognize, collect and transmit information that is associated with you or your computer and browser, but which does not personally identify you. Although the term "cookie" commonly is used to refer to a small text file stored on a computer that keeps track of your visits to web sites and/or can contain log-in information so you don't have to re-enter information each time you visit, we will use the term "cookie" to refer generically to any technology that can recognize, collect or transmit information about your visits to our Websites. "Cookie" information typically includes such data as the Internet or web domain that referred you, the type of operating system and browser you are using, the date and time of your visit, information relating to activities on our Websites (e.g., 'clickstream' data) and other technical attributes of your visits to our Website. No personally identifiable information is collected by this process and we use the information collected through cookies to analyze trends, administer our Websites, track movements on our Website and gather aggregate demographic information about visitors so we can continually improve our Website.  
 Cookies store information that allows our Website to recognize a users' computer or access device each time it is used to visit our Website and cookies can keep count of how often you return to our Website. Cookies can also track how you use our Website, your preferences for features and functions and can store information such as your log-in information, so you don't have to re-enter them each time you return to our Website. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer for purposes that are unrelated to our Website or your interaction with our Website.  
 You may stop or restrict cookies on your computer or purge them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences and you should consult the operating instructions that apply to your browser for instructions should you wish to do so and in general to determine how best to configure your browser settings to meet your requirements. Note that if you 'turn off,' purge or disable cookies, although you may still use our Website, you may not be able to use all of the features, functions or services available on our Website.  
 HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

We will provide you the opportunity to decline consent ("opt-out") of such differing uses.

We always request that our operational service providers protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal Information to third party marketers that are not associated with our Website, nor are they permitted to use your Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes.
