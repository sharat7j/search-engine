            The Powder Horn - Sheridan, Wyoming 
            6420 yards - par 72  
           By Aaron Atkins

                Nestled in a serene crook of the Bighorn  Mountains, a battle raged between two fierce young competitors during the final  round of the 81st Women’s Trans National Championship golf  tournament at the Powder Horn Golf Club in Sheridan, Wyo., on Sunday.   
               Sixteen-year-old Julie Yang of Mesa, Ariz., and  nineteen-year-old Alex Stewart of Carson City, Nev., squared off for 36 holes  during the final round of match play to decide who would walk away the 2011  champion and who would go home empty-handed.    
               While Yang would eventually triumph, nailing a putt for par  on the final hole and sinking a late rally by Stewart to finish one up, both  competitors walked away with their heads high, knowing they put everything they  had into their game.   
               Yang and Stewart were even after the first 18 holes, with  Yang birdying two holes and bogeying one, and Stewart birdying four times and  bogeying three. All Stewart’s birdies came on the back nine.   
               During the second set of 18, Yang birdied three and bogeyed  three on the front nine. Stewart got off to a slow start, bogeying three on the  front to fall into a three-hole deficit. 
          On the back nine, however, Stewart birdied four holes to  Yang’s two to close the gap to one. On the 18th and final hole, both  ladies made par and Yang walked away a one-up victor.           
               Starting the tournament off with stroke play, after two  rounds of 18 Yang was seeded 21st and Stewart 30th.  Neither golfer was considered a front-runner at the beginning of match play.  That moniker was given to No. 1-seeded Sunshine Baraquiel of Antipolo,  Philippines and defending champion Mia Piccio, also of the Philippines, and 2009 United States Golf Association girls’ junior  amateur champion Amy Anderson.            
               Baraquiel fell 2 and 1 to  Australian native Ashlee Dewhurst 2 and 1 in the quarterfinal round, Piccio  fell to 2010 Mexico Player of the Year in the second round and Anderson fell to  Stewart 5 and 3 in the semis.            
               Seven countries, including the United States, Australia,  Argentina, Ireland, Sri Lanka, Mexico and the Philippines were represented in  the tournament. 
               91 golfers began stroke play. 64 made the cut and  entered into five rounds of match play, with the field narrowing by half each round  until a champion emerged.

           2011 FOUR-BALL CHAMPIONS 
            MINA HARDIN  and JENNIE ROBINSON 
                       Tubac was terrific. 
          The weather and the golf were  great.  
    It seems that Mina Hardin is certainly enjoying her first year as a senior. She is the 2010  USGA Senior Women's Amateur Champion and now  with her playing partner, Jennie Robinson, she is a 2011 Trans Four-Ball Champion.

    The final round at Tubac Golf Resort in Tubac, Arizona was bright and sunny but a healthy wind developed as the morning hours turned into afternoon. However, Mina and Jennie ignored the wind, shooting 5 under 208 (69-71-68) for their three round tournament score. 

    This strong team  is looking forward to 2012 They  will be in attendance at the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort and Spa, Palm Desert, California,  to defend their title.
