Algebra Notes     
 Basic Algebraic Laws    Commutative Law For Addition: a + b = b + a  ex.  5 + 7 = 7 + 5 =12  Commutative Law For Multiplication:   a x b = b x a  ex.  3 x 6 = 6 x 3 = 18  Associative  Law For Addition:  (a + b) + c =  a + (b + c)  ex.  (4 + 6) + 5 = 4 + (6 + 5) = 15   Associative  Law For Multiplication:  (a x b) x c = a x (b x c)   ex.      (2 x 3) x 4 = 2 x  (3 x 4) = 24  Distributive  Law:  a x (b +c) = (a x b)  + (a x c)  ex.  3 x (2 + 5) =  (3 x 2) + (3 x 5)=21    
  
 
 
 
  
 

    Even though the above laws apply  to addition and multiplication, they do not apply to subtraction and division.     For example:  7 - 5 = 2, which is not the same as 5 - 7 = -2.  
        

   
 
 
   Some Basic Algebra Rules         The additive inverse for a is (-a)  for any constant.or variable.  a + (-a) = 0 
ex. 5 + (-5)= 0 
 
The mulitplicative inverse for a is 1/a for any constant or variable. a x 1/a = 1   
ex, 5 x 1/5 = 1 
 
The identity element for addition is 0 for any constant or variable.   a + 0 = a 
ex,  5 + 0 = 5 
 
The identity element for multiplication is 1 for any constant or variable.   a x 1 = a 
ex, 5 x 1 = 5 
     
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 

  
Rules for areas:  
 
   Rectangle or square = width x height 
 
   circle = 2 x pi x radius x radius 
 
   triangle = 1/2 x base x height 
 
 
  Polynomial Solutions for  y = ax 2  + bx + c   
Sqrt is the same as square root here.    
 x =     -b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)               2a  
 
 

   
 
 
 
  
 

   
Distance Formula between two points on a cartesian graph     
 
   Let the first point be (x 1 ,y 1 ) and the second point be (x 2 ,y 2 ).  We use the Pythagorean thereom for a right triangle, using the length between the two x values as one side and the length between the y values as another side of  a right triangle.   The diagonal line, or shortest distance between the two points would be the hypotenuse of that right triangle.  The distance, which we'll call z, between those two points would be: 
 
z^2 = (x 2  - x 1 )^2 + (y 2  - y 1 )^2  
 
We solve for z by taking the square root of both sides.   Sqrt is the same as square root here. 
 
We get z =      sqrt[(x 2  - x 1 )^2 + [(y 2  - y 1 )^2 ] 
 

   
 
 
 
  
 

  Rules For Exponential Forms Under Multiplication And Division 
  
 
x m   times x n  = x  m + n             ex.  2 3  x 2 4  = 2 3 + 4  = x 7  
 
x m divided by x n  = x m - n                   ex.  2 7  / 2 4  = 2 7 - 4  = 2 3 

   
 
 
 
  
 

  Rules For Exponentials Being Raised To A Power 
  
 
(x m ) n  = x m^n  = x mn      ex. (x 5 ) 3  = x  5^3  = x 15 

   
 
 
 
  
 

  Rules For Exponentials and 1/N Roots  
 
(x m ) 1/n  = x  m/n      ex. (x 15 ) 1/3  = x 5 

   
 
 
 
  
 

  Steps For Solving For A Single Variable Equation 
  
 
ex.  4x - 9 = 7 + 9x + 19   
    4x - 9 = 26 + 9x          Combine Like Terms.  In the case,          +9  =  +9                 add the 7 and the19.  Add 9 to both                                       sides to get rid of the 9 on the left                                      hand side.  9 is the additive                                      inverse of -9 and will cancel that                                     term to zero.             4x  + 0 = 35 + 9x     -9x      =       - 9x       We need to get rid of the 9x                                        on the  right side now, so we'll                                       subtract both sides by -9x.              -5x = 35    (-1)(-5x) = (-1)(20)        Multiply both sides by -1 to get rid                                       of the minus sign in front of the -5x.            5x = -35    (1/5)(5x) = (1/5)(-35)      Multiply both sides by 1/5, which                                      is the same as dividing both sides                                       by 5.   We want to get rid of the 5 in                                       front of the x to solve for x.              x = -7                  Our solution to the equation is x =                                        -7,  If you plug -7 into the                                        original equation, the right side will                                        equal the left side of the equation.
