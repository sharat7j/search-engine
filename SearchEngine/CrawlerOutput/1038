                            Seeing Statistics ¨  is a new
                            approach to teaching statistics using the World Wide Web. This  webbook is based on
                            three premises: 
                           
                             The important principles of statistics 
                              are remarkably easy if they can be seen.  
                             
                             Active involvement of the student facilitates learning.  
                             Statistics can be fun! 
                           
                         
                           
                               
                                                                  
                               
                             
                         
                        
                           Most of the graphs and figures in this textbook are dynamic
                            and under the  control of the
                              reader. Interacting with the graphs allows you to see the important statistical principles
                              in action.
